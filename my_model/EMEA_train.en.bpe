In addition, MabThera can be used to treat adults with severe rheumatoid arthritis (a disease that causes inflammation of the joint@@ s).
In addition there are only limited data available on the pharmacokinetics of sal@@ me@@ ter@@ ol because of the technical difficulty of assa@@ ying the drug in plasma due to the low plasma concentrations at therapeutic doses (approximately 200 pic@@ og@@ ram@@ / ml or less@@ ) achieved after inhaled dosing.

Therefore, losartan should be used with caution in these patient groups.
Therefore, losartan is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Losartan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.
Losartan is predominantly metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP@@ ) 2@@ C@@ 9 to the active carbox@@ y-@@ acid metabolite.
Both biliary and urinary excretion contribute to the elimination of losartan and its metabolit@@ es.
Both losartan and its principal active metabolite have a far greater affinity for the AT@@ 1 receptor than for the AT@@ 2 receptor.
Therefore, los@@ artan@@ / hydrochlorothiazide should not be administered to children and adolescents.

Paxene has also been shown to improve the survival time for some types of cancer.
Paxene has been studied in 10@@ 7 patients with Kar@@ posi@@ 's sarcom@@ a.
Paxene contains polyox@@ yl castor oil, which can cause an allergic reaction.
Paxene should be administered via an infusion control device (@@ pum@@ p) using non-@@ PVC tubing and connec@@ tors.
Paxene should be administered through an in-line filter with a micro@@ po@@ rous membrane not greater than 0.@@ 22 µ@@ m.
Paxene should be given before cisplatin when used in combination (see 4.5).
Paxene is very similar to another authorised medicine containing paclitaxel (T@@ ax@@ ol@@ ) and the studies supporting the use of T@@ ax@@ ol were used to support the use of Pax@@ ene.
Pregn@@ ant staff should not handle Pax@@ ene.

Tritanrix HepB has been studied in six studies involving a total of 8@@ 72 infants aged between seven and 20 weeks, all of whom received the vaccine.
When an infant is given the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the bacteria and viruses contained in the vaccine as ‘ foreign'and makes antibodies against them.
Tritanrix HepB contains diphther@@ ia (D@@ ), tetanus (@@ T) tox@@ oid@@ s, inactivated pertussis bacteria (P@@ w@@ ) and the puri@@ fied major surface anti@@ gen of the hepatitis B virus (@@ HB@@ V@@ ), ad@@ sor@@ bed on aluminium sal@@ ts.
Tritanrix HepB should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects.
Tritanrix HepB is for deep intramuscular injection, preferably in the an@@ ter@@ ol@@ ateral thigh@@ .
Tritanrix HepB is given by deep injection into a muscle@@ , preferably the thigh@@ .
Tritanrix HepB is contraindicated if the child has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown a@@ eti@@ ology, occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis containing vaccine.
Tritanrix HepB is available in the following pack siz@@ es:
Tritanrix HepB is indicated for active immunisation against diphther@@ ia, tetan@@ us, pertussis and hepatitis B (@@ HB@@ V) in infants from 6 weeks on@@ wards (see section 4.2).
Tritanrix HepB is a white, slightly milk@@ y liquid presented in a glass vial for 2 doses (1 ml) or in a glass vial for 10 doses (5 ml).
Tritanrix HepB is a vaccine, which is available as a suspension for injection.
Tritanrix HepB is a vaccine used in children to prevent four diseas@@ es: diphther@@ ia, tetanus (@@ lock@@ j@@ aw@@ ), pertussis (@@ who@@ op@@ ing cough@@ ) and hepatitis B.
As Tritanrix HepB is not intended for use in adults, information on the safety of the vaccine when used during pregnancy or lactation is not available.
Tritanrix HepB can be mixed with the lyophil@@ ised H@@ ib vaccine (H@@ iber@@ ix@@ ).
