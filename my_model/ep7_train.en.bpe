The situations in the Member States diff@@ er, as has emerg@@ ed from this study.
Con@@ flic@@ ts between us can be counted on the fing@@ ers of one hand.
Tr@@ ag@@ ic events such as the one that took place in D@@ over last June or those that have come to light following the successful '@@ C@@ ath@@ ed@@ ral@@ ' police operation are situations that no democratic society can toler@@ ate.
Sit@@ u@@ ations outside an air@@ line@@ 's control cannot be forese@@ en.
Ex@@ traordinary situations require clear joint action.
The scenari@@ os can vary a great de@@ al.
There are different situations in the different Member States. In some Member States, there are ch@@ iro@@ pr@@ act@@ ors, practition@@ ers of different types of mass@@ age, non-@@ medical practition@@ ers, ac@@ up@@ unc@@ tu@@ rist@@ s, and so on@@ ; and patients from other Member States must be provided with access to their services if they so wish@@ .
The situations are very differen@@ t: the money has a different valu@@ e.

Soci@@ olog@@ ists and dem@@ ograph@@ ers all agree that it is the family that binds together a social system.
O@@ ut@@ patient treatment now presents no problems for the citizens of the EU and in@@ patient treatment has become much simpl@@ er.
Bas@@ ic care must be less expensive and access to medicines more aff@@ ord@@ able.
Te@@ e@@ th, gl@@ asses and personal care fall somewhere in bet@@ we@@ en.
Healthcare is after all a specific sector requiring a specific approach.
Healthcare and education have become im@@ possible.
Health care and care of the elder@@ ly, whilst an important part of the overall health system, does not necessarily represent the overall health system.
Health care and care for the elderly are examples of areas in which the EU should only have limited compe@@ t@@ ence.
High@@ ly specialised healthcare has evol@@ ved as@@ ym@@ me@@ tric@@ ally, with the development of centres of excell@@ ence in certain countries for rare or chronic diseases which are not common in that specific place but require speci@@ alisation.
Health care, child@@ care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas that are not directly cross-@@ border@@ .
Healthcare should never be treated as a commercial market serv@@ ice.
Healthcare should not be a commodity.
Health care is not simply a commercial product or service that is trad@@ ed within the free market.
Healthcare is a national compe@@ t@@ ence, but there are points of contact with Europe.
Healthcare is and must remain a national pre@@ rog@@ ative.
The added value of cross-border health care is also evident for people see@@ king highly specialised treatment, which only a very limited number of practition@@ ers in Europe can provi@@ de.
The health care in question is a treatment that must be given to a person who resid@@ es tempor@@ arily in another countr@@ y's territor@@ y, so that this person is not in danger of death and forced to return pre@@ mat@@ urely to his country of origin in order to receive the necessary health care.
Health@@ care, and health itsel@@ f, are comm@@ odi@@ ties which a part of the population is finding it increasingly difficult to aff@@ or@@ d.
Pa@@ ren@@ tal care is not a lux@@ ury for a child, but a natural stand@@ ard.
The care a child receives in the earli@@ est years will have an impact on him or her throughout life.
Psychiatric care requires more immediate atten@@ tion: living conditions for patients are poor and budgetary resourc@@ es, as was imp@@ li@@ ed, are limited.

The Iraq@@ i soldiers had broken every single bone in that man@@ ' s body.
Bul@@ l@@ doz@@ ers were sent in to raz@@ e houses to the ground and, to make certain that under no circumstances could anything living be found or a single body du@@ g out, tanks were subsequently sent in so that there was little more than a broad road where the houses had be@@ en.

S@@ oil nur@@ tured by farmers re@@ tain@@ s its fertilit@@ y, but when it is depri@@ ved of this care it turn@@ s into a deser@@ t.
S@@ oil that is not used for agricultural purposes soon becomes de@@ gra@@ ded.
The soil also perform@@ s many other important function@@ s: it is a substr@@ ate for human activi@@ ties, along with town@@ s and infra@@ struc@@ ture, and also for nature and valu@@ able land@@ scap@@ es.
S@@ oil is a farm@@ er's most preci@@ ous asse@@ t.
The soil is liv@@ ing, it absor@@ bs CO@@ 2, it produces biom@@ ass@@ : it must be safeguar@@ ded, it must even be improv@@ ed, because European soil is particularly pollut@@ ed.
S@@ oil varies enorm@@ ously but it should be living and renew@@ ing.
S@@ hor@@ t@@ -term solutions are not an answer to the widespread and deep@@ -@@ ro@@ o@@ ted problems of Rom@@ a.
Active solu@@ tions, such as '@@ B@@ ra@@ ke As@@ sist@@ ', have the advantage over passive safety systems that they also prevent a great deal of additional adverse effects of accid@@ ents, such as hol@@ d-@@ up@@ s, traffic j@@ ams and non-@@ material harm@@ , that cannot be limited by applying passive safety systems.
Are the solutions that have been reached better than those of the first read@@ ing, or has the legislation simply been diluted and further weakened in the course of the six '@@ tri@@ alogu@@ es@@ '?
Ex@@ pen@@ sive solutions are not always the most effective.
The CI@@ A@@ ’s solutions are un@@ sustain@@ able, both in the short and the long term and for both the EU and the rest of the world.
The peace process often gr@@ in@@ ds to a hal@@ t because un@@ explo@@ ded bom@@ ble@@ ts close off whole areas.
Sol@@ u@@ tions should include restric@@ ting the scope of the transferred data and list@@ ing the types of data that the designated provi@@ ders are able to filter and extr@@ act, as well as the types of data which may be included in a transfer@@ .
Y@@ ester@@ day@@ ’s solutions are no longer an op@@ tion.
Di@@ pl@@ om@@ atic solutions must be preferred to an escal@@ ation of violence and other ou@@ trag@@ es.
The solutions must, therefore, be international and glob@@ al.
'@@ E@@ '-@@ solutions provide the possibility of particip@@ ation with minimal eff@@ ort@@ : there are no qu@@ eu@@ es or officials exercising the right of discre@@ tion.
European solutions are needed.
A compreh@@ ensi@@ ve, systemic solution is often defe@@ ated by details or even by lob@@ b@@ ying interest@@ s.
There is no long-term military solution.
Mil@@ itary solutions have never last@@ ed in A@@ ce@@ h@@ .
The solutions are only effective in@@ as@@ much as they are inter@@ depend@@ ent.
The solutions are not yet fully mat@@ ure, but there are certainly already some practical steps which can be taken quickly.
However, the solutions are not simple@@ , and we should not over@@ act.
The solutions range from optim@@ ising the use of existing capacity to perhaps revis@@ ing the regulations on s@@ lo@@ ts.
The potential solutions are acknowledg@@ ed: region@@ alisation of management for greater flex@@ ib@@ ility, more accurate scientific evaluation of resources to avoid disput@@ es, greater involvement of the prof@@ ession ?
The solutions proposed on sum@@ mon@@ ing people, on the rules for the represent@@ ation of def@@ end@@ ants and on re@@ trials or appe@@ als must be read in conjunction with one another.
There are a vari@@ ety of solutions.
So, the solutions are on the table.
Technical solutions can vary a great de@@ al.
Sol@@ vents are one of the main causes of oz@@ one form@@ ation, and this has serious consequenc@@ es, first of all for public health@@ : respiratory diseases and breathing problems can be asc@@ ribed to emissions of volati@@ le organic compoun@@ ds.
The su@@ ms in question sometimes def@@ y beli@@ ef@@ .
In@@ vest@@ ments that do not bring a value added element with regard to the environment mean less invest@@ ments that are of benefit to the environment.

The EU-@@ LA@@ C summit meetings are not just events where el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent statements are made and gr@@ and design@@ s are announc@@ ed but never materi@@ alis@@ e.
Opinion poll@@ s (F@@ ood Cent@@ re@@ ) and surveys (in the S@@ atur@@ day 2 December edi@@ tion of the Al@@ ge@@ me@@ en D@@ ag@@ blad@@ ) show that nearly half of all parents are in favour of restric@@ ting or banning aggressive advertis@@ ing.
Opinion poll@@ s, whatever questions are put@@ , can sometimes tend to make you feel qu@@ eas@@ y.
Euro@@ bar@@ ometer surveys show that 8@@ 1% of Europeans back the use of an organ donor car@@ d, but only 12% of them actually carry one.
The regular Euro@@ bar@@ ometer surveys suggest that these visits are effective in promoting awareness of the European Ombuds@@ man, which often increases after a vis@@ it.
Opinion surveys have shown that large sections of the population are opposed to EM@@ U@@ , especially in Swed@@ en.
Al@@ arm b@@ ell@@ s are ringing and they cannot be igno@@ red.
Non-@@ path@@ ogenic multi-@@ resistant strain@@ s of bacteria also represent a risk in view of the possibility of trans@@ genic transf@@ ers and, according to the latest research, shared resistance.
No dead@@ lines have been met by the Sud@@ an@@ es@@ e.
The resulting tragic human suffering continu@@ es, with hundreds of thousands of pover@@ ty-@@ str@@ ick@@ en refuge@@ es, thousands of mal@@ n@@ ouris@@ hed and dying children, and the reported emergence in the region of cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases like choler@@ a and hepati@@ tis.
Sus@@ pic@@ ions on that score are rif@@ e.

The specul@@ ators are stuff@@ ing themselves on tax@@ pay@@ ers' money and are clearly set to ble@@ ed them dr@@ y.
The specul@@ ators will then turn their attention to Italy, to the UK and to Spain.
Spec@@ ulation about the orig@@ ins of individual animals remains rif@@ e.
P@@ FO@@ S and P@@ FO@@ S@@ -related substances are highly fluor@@ inated and extremely difficult to break down.
P@@ FO@@ S, a hal@@ ogen@@ ated hydro@@ carb@@ on, is toxic to humans, and also both carcinogenic and mutagen@@ ic.
Mer@@ cur@@ y sp@@ hy@@ g@@ mom@@ an@@ ome@@ ters used in the treatment of high blood pressure or arrhyth@@ m@@ ia do not have an equivalent substitute capable of equal accur@@ ac@@ y, and alternative methods would be extremely expen@@ sive.
S@@ phy@@ g@@ mom@@ an@@ ome@@ ters are, in any case, used only in certain medical applic@@ ations, and are absolutely in@@ dispens@@ able in certain medical situations in which measurements are required to be of the ut@@ most exac@@ ti@@ tu@@ de.
S@@ pir@@ its made from ban@@ an@@ as, for example, rather than from pot@@ ato@@ es, cere@@ als or mol@@ ass@@ es, should not be called ban@@ ana vod@@ k@@ a, but ban@@ ana drink or ban@@ ana spir@@ it.

Le@@ ad stabil@@ is@@ ers, in other words organ@@ o@@ tin and lead compoun@@ ds, are the most relevant ones and the environmental risks are high@@ er, especially in the case of lead stabil@@ is@@ ers.

P@@ etro@@ l stations are dr@@ y.
Author@@ ised service st@@ ations, too, must have the right to buy parts from independent produc@@ ers, as well as the tools and equipment used in their work@@ shop@@ s.
En@@ erg@@ y statistics are like the steel ro@@ ds holding up a build@@ ing: you cannot see them from the outside but without them the whole building collap@@ ses.
Statistics show that mut@@ ual trade is growing shar@@ ply and fl@@ ouris@@ h@@ ing.
Statistics have to be compreh@@ ensi@@ ve, reliable and consist@@ ent.
Statistics on the number of people diagnosed with dementia reveal the enorm@@ ity of the problem.
That is clear from Euro@@ st@@ at statis@@ tic@@ s: it was approximately 90% in both 2007 and 2008.
The statistics provided by international organisations are app@@ alling - they say that around 150 000 Christi@@ ans are murdered worldwide every year.
Statistics show that the alternative solutions have caused many deaths in the work@@ place.
Statistics show that one person out of every five above the age of 80 suffers from Alzheimer's disease.
Statistics show a ste@@ adily increasing number of reports to all hot@@ lin@@ es.
It will be clear from the app@@ ended statistics how di@@ re is the situation of women in developing countries as regards their reproductive health and the continuing high death rates among infants, children and their mothers.
The most recent statistics still indicate not only an increase within the EU of the number of new HIV infections, but also a large proportion of HIV infections which are still un@@ diagno@@ sed.
There are statistics showing that this disease results in a huge loss of population mainly of working and retire@@ ment age.
The statistical surveys show that the spread in deficit and growth levels is too wide as well as demonstr@@ ating a cor@@ relation between high defic@@ its and low growth rates.
The statistics show that the programme only allevi@@ ates the problem of malnutrition but is not elimin@@ ating it.
Statistics show that products of unknown origin noti@@ fied through Rap@@ ex we@@ re, for the first time, down to 3% in October 2007, as compared to 17% in 2006.
Statistics show that products of unknown origin noti@@ fied through RAP@@ EX were down for the first time in October 2007, standing at 3% as compared to 17% in 2006.
Statistics show that around one in three young Europeans has tried an ill@@ ic@@ it drug and at least one of our citizens dies every hour from a drug over@@ dose.
The statistics provide no information on the extent to which the recorded increase in reported cases of domestic violence is related to the increased willing@@ ness of the victims to stand up for themselves or what proportion of these are immigr@@ ants.
Therefore, the statistics often do not provide us with the relevant information about how many people are seriously ill@@ , how many suffer and how many die as a result of this ill@@ ness.
These statistics are not comparable between different countries and are difficult to interpre@@ t.
The statistics speak for themselves, as Commissioner R@@ eding is well awa@@ re: the age at which children access the Internet has dropped consider@@ ably.
The figures from the World Health Organ@@ isation@@ 's latest research show that the percentage of carri@@ ers of the virus remains at the same level, whilst the number of new cases has fall@@ en.
The statistics on Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are extremely wor@@ ry@@ ing, such as the fact that every year, 1.4 million citizens living in the European Union develop some kind of dementia and a new case is diagnosed every 24 second@@ s.
The statistics are alarm@@ ing, above all, with regard to Italy, where the average payment is made at 18@@ 6 days, pe@@ aking at 800 days in regional government with regard to the health sector.
The statistics are rather f@@ righ@@ ten@@ ing.
The statistics are hor@@ rif@@ ying.
One of these is provided by qu@@ arter@@ ly statistics on job vac@@ anc@@ ies in the Commun@@ ity.
What the report calls '@@ ste@@ re@@ oty@@ p@@ ing' may be just a qu@@ ick way to link a product to a particular group of consumers.

Cere@@ al stocks in the EU have been reduced.
Good examples of some success can be seen in stocks such as sa@@ i@@ the@@ , North Se@@ a ha@@ d@@ doc@@ k and m@@ ack@@ e@@ rel@@ , which are fish@@ ed close to MS@@ Y level and which are generally stable and profit@@ able.
St@@ oc@@ ks of her@@ ring and sp@@ rat continue to be very health@@ y.
St@@ oc@@ ks of blue and white mar@@ lin are severely deple@@ ted in the Atlantic and they do need protec@@ tion.
St@@ oc@@ ks of deep@@ -@@ sea fish are, however, very sensitive in biological term@@ s, as they have a very low breeding rate and grow very slowly - substantially more slowly than other types of fish.
The intervention stocks at the end of the budgetary year are likely to be no more than about 2 million tonnes, consist@@ ing mainly of ry@@ e and bar@@ le@@ y.
The stock@@ pil@@ es were so high that they would last worldwide for two years.
The sto@@ res down there are emp@@ ty.
The estimated global stocks are 1.3 million tonnes.
St@@ oc@@ ks are high and, as a result, prices for many w@@ ines are low and income for wine-@@ grow@@ ers has been reduced.
St@@ omat@@ olog@@ ists in the European Union use 1@@ 25 tonnes of mercury each year.
Long-term strategies must be put in place to ensure that the po@@ ore@@ r and peripheral regions of my country are helped to become competitive in terms of the at@@ trac@@ tion of bus@@ iness, as well as the improvement of their respective transport and water@@ -@@ treatment services.
The common strategies have not always worked in the way that the Council and others had hop@@ ed.
Common strategies are being develop@@ ed, the cat@@ er@@ pill@@ ar trac@@ ks are being brought out and put on.
Consequently, strategies and measures to improve OS@@ H must be specifically adapted to particular work@@ plac@@ es, taking into account the fact that some factors might affect women and men differen@@ tly.
The stress tests proposed by the Commission are necessary.
There are not enough facilities for the care of children and other depend@@ ents and in general there is a lack of flex@@ ib@@ ility.
Str@@ uc@@ tures set up for the purpose of helping the cause of the Rom@@ a often use this cause as a pre@@ text.
The active substances that are most frequently discovered in concentrations exceeding the EU residue limits should not be marketed any more, because they have thereby prov@@ ed, I am afraid to say, that they are un@@ control@@ lab@@ le.
Chem@@ ic@@ als are present every@@ where, and the recent increase in certain types of cancer or leukaemia has to make us question the use of certain chemic@@ als.
CM@@ R substances, carcinogen@@ ic, mutagenic or re@@ pro@@ toxic substances have still not been removed from children's to@@ ys.
It is the substances contained in ho@@ p con@@ es that determine the mel@@ low bit@@ tern@@ ess, the head@@ , the ease of preserv@@ ation and the typical ar@@ oma of a be@@ er.
O@@ zon@@ e-@@ destro@@ ying substances have a del@@ e@@ ter@@ ious effect over a very long period.
The substances available on the market, although not included in the list of banned substances, are very difficult to control@@ , making it impossible for medical staff to provide assistance as the chemical combinations used have unknown reactions.
The substances in question will therefore be included in the third list of priorities under Council Regulation No 79@@ 3@@ /9@@ 3 on the assessment and control of risks associated with existing substances, provided that the precise chemical identity of these substances is established and the producers and im@@ por@@ ters of the substances are known.
Un@@ wanted substances and products must be excluded in a secure and controlled manner.
The substances which are the subject of this report have clear and demonstrated beneficial properties as flame retard@@ ants in materials and products such as fo@@ am@@ -filled fur@@ nit@@ ure.
The substances that have been allowed into food must be approv@@ ed, and active packaging must not be misleading to consumers.
Natur@@ ally occurring substances in water must be examined when setting limit valu@@ es; the high arsen@@ ic content of ground@@ water in the Sou@@ thern Pl@@ ain@@ s region in Hungary is a good example.
Chem@@ ical substances or techniques are used for body care, food and health products.
The frag@@ r@@ ances do nothing for the children or for the to@@ y.
The pollut@@ ants em@@ itted depend both on the nature of the waste to be treated and the technologies used to treat this waste.
Those chemicals that need to be authorised are not just any old ones.
Subst@@ ances that pose a risk to health must be withdra@@ wn, and the overall amount of pesticides we use must be reduced.
Subst@@ ances that cause allerg@@ ies, not in every@@ one, but in certain people who cannot resist them, simply have no place in deter@@ g@@ ents.
Subst@@ ances considered dangerous in one country may have a different regime in another country.
For instance, will toxic substances mig@@ rate into the air and will people living in neighbour@@ ing countries, such as Sloven@@ ia, be in any danger if they inhal@@ e them?
EU subsidies have even been adjusted accordingly.
EU subsidies have nevertheless been widely used to encourage concentration of abat@@ to@@ ir capac@@ ities.
A further bone of cont@@ en@@ tion is the area direct pay@@ ments.
Sub@@ sidi@@ es must be examined for their effectiveness and changed or replaced by other measures if necessary.
Sub@@ sidi@@ es should be chann@@ elled into these areas and not into short-term support determined by fluctu@@ ating oil prices.
Sub@@ sidi@@ es make for ine@@ ffici@@ ency and increase costs.
Sub@@ sidi@@ es are not the best way of doing so, as they are mere drops in the oc@@ e@@ an.
The subsidies will be discontinued, but this will be carefully manag@@ ed, taking into consideration both jobs and the environment.
Pre@@ vi@@ ous subsidies ough@@ t, there@@ fore. to be re@@ cl@@ ai@@ med.
Fun@@ ds are granted by the Commission in accordance with the usual rul@@ es.
Sub@@ sidi@@ es are too bureauc@@ rati@@ c@@ : there won@@ 't be a pen@@ ny for the risk-@@ bearing entrepre@@ neur@@ .
The earlier successes of the D@@ aph@@ ne programme make it clear that the programme must be continued.
The high points of the histor@@ ic year of 2004 were followed by a particularly difficult phase.
The fact is that the successes and the credit side of the R@@ ose Rev@@ ol@@ ution in Ge@@ org@@ ia have been tar@@ n@@ ished in recent months and years by a good few author@@ itarian decisions which have enc@@ ro@@ ach@@ ed on the powers of the judic@@ i@@ ary.
The successes that have been achieved cannot make their impact felt when cor@@ ruption is un@@ check@@ ed, the law is un@@ st@@ able, and long over@@ due re@@ forms are not carried out.
The successes of popul@@ ist parties across Europe demonstrate that the sp@@ ark can all of a sudden ign@@ it@@ e.
The subjects of both reports are rel@@ ated.
T@@ op@@ ics should be inter@@ lin@@ k@@ ed.
These are difficult issu@@ es.
Per@@ fluoro@@ oc@@ t@@ ane sulphon@@ ates (P@@ FO@@ S) are toxic@@ , persistent and bio@@ accum@@ ulative substances present in applications such as chro@@ mium pl@@ ating, water@@ pro@@ of@@ ing and fire resistance.
The super@@ -@@ cred@@ its to manufacturers producing L@@ CV@@ s with emissions of CO2 of less than 50@@ g CO@@ 2@@ /@@ km will be limited with a threshold of 25 000 L@@ CV@@ s per manufacturer@@ ;
Super@@ markets frequently stay open until 10@@  @@ p.m. on week@@ days, and sometimes even round the c@@ loc@@ k.
N@@ utri@@ tional supplements should be subject to the same rules as additive pre@@ mix@@ es, given that both categories of products generally contain the same proportion of addi@@ tives.
N@@ utri@@ tional supplements are intended to adjust an animal@@ 's nutritional intake in response to a temporary increase in its nutritional requirements brought about by critical breeding or living conditions, such as during cal@@ v@@ ing, we@@ an@@ ing or at point of la@@ y.
The removal of the points dealing with the following issues is particularly signific@@ ant@@ :
Fab@@ ric@@ ations and specul@@ ations persist only in the absence of truth@@ .
Over@@ capac@@ ities must be converted into new work meth@@ odic@@ ally and with an equal division of burden@@ s.
The present excessive tal@@ k, like the increased figh@@ ting, lead no@@ where.
Sur@@ f@@ ers and diver@@ s, for example, are often in the water.
The surviv@@ ors of the disaster need clean drinking water, which cannot be provided on a sustainable basis without good treatment pl@@ ants.
Sus@@ pec@@ ts and def@@ end@@ ants have rights both as people and as parties to proceed@@ ings.
Suspen@@ sions and reserv@@ ations often lead to the necessary improv@@ ements.
Sy@@ mb@@ ols and te@@ ars are no longer enough.
The national symb@@ ols - the flag and an@@ them - were not changed and are still those of the MP@@ L@@ A part@@ y.
The symb@@ ols for alum@@ ini@@ um, glass and plas@@ tic, however, also show '@@ ch@@ as@@ ing' ar@@ row@@ s, thus indicating to the consumer that the materials are recycl@@ able, and in this way could give misleading information.
The symb@@ ols were chosen through the work of the European Committee for Stand@@ ardis@@ ation (C@@ EN@@ ).
The intention of the symb@@ ols is to indicate to consumers that the packaging can be re@@ used or recycle@@ d.
Symptoms include diarrhoea and dehydr@@ ation.
The symptoms of allergy are trig@@ ge@@ red by chemic@@ als, natural and artificial food addi@@ tives, sp@@ ic@@ es, pol@@ len and other natural substances, and animal hair@@ .
The symptoms are different from those caused by the wea@@ ther, for example, but they co@@ inc@@ ide with the use of new gener@@ ations of neuro@@ toxic systemic active substances used for pel@@ le@@ ting on larg@@ e-@@ scale crops close to the hiv@@ es.
The effects are common but every@@ one's experience is differen@@ t.
Tr@@ ade un@@ ion@@ ists are pro@@ secu@@ ted and sentenced in sha@@ m trials.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome has so far attacked 2 4@@ 16 people of all ages and has caused 89 death@@ s, mainly in Asi@@ a.

The supervision and monitoring systems were not yet fully inst@@ al@@ led, were not yet operating effec@@ tivel@@ y, and payments continue to be largely b@@ ligh@@ ted by erro@@ r@@ s.
The monitoring systems vary too much and the way the results are presented in the Commission report is too restric@@ ted.

Gen@@ eration IV nuclear energy systems will allow better nuclear waste management and decrease its quanti@@ ty.
P@@ N@@ R systems have been evaluated by the authorities in each country.

Re@@ use systems have been shown to be beneficial to the environment, provided a minimum number of re@@ use cycles is achieved and transport dist@@ ances are not too gre@@ at.
Health@@ -@@ care systems, especially in the 12 new@@ er Member States, need in many cases a complete over@@ haul@@ , with attention required to the structural improvement of hospit@@ als, the moder@@ n@@ isation of equipment and up@@ -to-@@ date training of health person@@ nel.
Evaluation systems in the form of what are known as EC@@ TS points should be clear, understand@@ able and un@@ ified.
In@@ tel@@ lig@@ ent vehicle systems help to avoid risk@@ y situations altogether and, by eas@@ ing the burden on driver@@ s, are conduc@@ ive to a more relax@@ ed and fo@@ resi@@ gh@@ ted driving sty@@ le.
The '@@ support systems for you@@ th@@ ' are to receive at least 15@@ %; by this is meant the European You@@ th For@@ um and the network of youth organisations and persons active in this field whom it support@@ s.
Systems are being connected and electricity trading is moving at a faster pac@@ e, which means that there is an increasing need for tim@@ ely and more detailed information about electricity flow@@ s.
Systems such as adap@@ tive cru@@ ise control (A@@ CC@@ ), lan@@ e-@@ change assist@@ ance, and electronic st@@ ability control (E@@ S@@ C) are technically well developed and highly reli@@ able.
Systems such as SOL@@ V@@ IT contribute to that.
TAC@@ s and quot@@ as only control what is lan@@ ded, they do not control what is cau@@ gh@@ t.
The tasks to be done must be meaningful and challeng@@ ing, and a European certific@@ ate must be a@@ war@@ ded immediately after partic@@ i@@ pation, desc@@ rib@@ ing the skills obtained by the particip@@ ant through voluntary work.
The tasks in this field should and will be performed by the European Ombuds@@ man.
In terms of both work and cooperation this has been a very bus@@ y time for me.
The various tasks on the list of priorities should be tack@@ led one by one.
The tasks that they may carry out are the same.

Stal@@ in@@ ism and N@@ az@@ ism are two sides of the same ide@@ ology.
Ch@@ arg@@ es are generally higher in the cohes@@ ion countries than in the more advanced countries of the Union. Simil@@ arly, the number of personal compu@@ ters is low@@ er.
T@@ at@@ to@@ os, however, are much less satisfactor@@ y.
T@@ at@@ to@@ os can cause problems, they can become difficult to read or they can be altered.
The ill-@@ defined status of Kosov@@ o is a latent source of uncertain@@ ty.
The status of Ab@@ ye@@ i remains uncertain@@ .
The position with regard to pe@@ at cannot be determined according to the same standards as bi@@ og@@ as@@ es, for example.
The Staff Regulations allow the European In@@ stitu@@ tions to recru@@ it three main types of staff@@ : permanent offici@@ als, temporary agents and contract agents.
The status of Kosov@@ o was virtually the same as that of the f@@ ed@@ eral re@@ public@@ s.
L@@ eg@@ al status has been thus prac@@ tically evaluated.
In Ireland we have a very high level of abor@@ tion, disproportion@@ ately high in comparison with other EU countries.
The rates of 15 to 25@@ %, which allow no distinc@@ tion between immediate nec@@ es@@ sities and lux@@ uri@@ es, the uniform rates which require the poor worker and the rich business@@ man to pay the same exc@@ ise and tax to@@ oth@@ past@@ e at the same rate as a y@@ ach@@ t, are often higher than the rates at which big business is tax@@ ed direc@@ tly.

Mor@@ tal@@ ity rates while waiting for a heart, liver or lung transplant usually range from 15% to 30@@ %.
Mor@@ tal@@ ity rate while waiting for a heart, liver or lung transplant usually rang@@ es from 15 to 30@@ %.
Mor@@ tal@@ ity rates among people waiting for a heart, liver or lung transplant are between 15% and 30@@ %, so patients who need an organ transplant will have to wait less time for that operation, thanks to this new directive.
Mor@@ tal@@ ity and mor@@ b@@ idity is higher in cl@@ ones than in sex@@ u@@ ally-@@ produced animal@@ s; the welfare of both sur@@ ro@@ gate dam and cl@@ one can be affected.

The average growth rates on which the Commission has based this will have to be constantly reviewed in the light of the most recent economic data, since annual growth rates can fluctu@@ ate consider@@ ably over a period of seven years.
Con@@ sumption taxes usually have a fair imp@@ act, as the rich@@ est are also those who con@@ sume the most and who therefore pay the mo@@ st.
Green taxes such as reduced VA@@ T rates can also have a similar effect, by stimulating demand for low consumption vehicles and domestic appli@@ ances.

The political pre@@ varic@@ ating of recent weeks has not only damaged Greec@@ e.
Adequate and inadequ@@ ate, in my view, are not particularly appropriate terms to use.
The letter of the law is important and must be controlled, but its application must be equally control@@ led.
The term '@@ sexual and reproductive righ@@ t@@ s' is therefore in@@ appropriate.
The terms of the debate are famili@@ ar.
The words of the D@@ omin@@ ic@@ an L@@ ac@@ or@@ da@@ ire are ap@@ t he@@ re: '@@ Between the weak and the strong@@ , between the rich and the po@@ or, between the lor@@ d and the sl@@ av@@ e, it is freedom which op@@ pres@@ ses and the law which sets free@@ .'
E-@@ euro@@ pe@@ , e-@@ lear@@ ning, e-@@ comm@@ erc@@ e, e-@@ business are on every@@ one's lip@@ s, and are increasingly setting the political agenda.
Working terms and conditions cannot be driven by the situation on the labour market, and availability for work.
The words ‘@@ travel@@ ’ and ‘@@ vo@@ y@@ age@@ ’ should reg@@ ain their original mean@@ ings.
The terms harmonisation and level playing field have been the g@@ ate@@ way to a suff@@ oc@@ at@@ ingly leg@@ alis@@ tic system.
The terms used most often are econom@@ ically dependent workers or par@@ a-@@ sub@@ ordin@@ ate workers and persons who per@@ form work similar to that of an employe@@ e.
Dutch terms such as or may continue to be used to describe cough swe@@ ets, since everyone appreci@@ ates that these s@@ wee@@ ts cannot always immediately make the cough disappear.
The terms '@@ shar@@ ing' and '@@ po@@ ol@@ ing' describe what is now needed.
The concept of '@@ reproductive and sexual health and righ@@ t@@ s' would then have been clearly defin@@ ed, in terms of the protection of the unborn child, by means of the following word@@ ing: '@@ In the context of this Regul@@ ation, abor@@ tion, which can never be promo@@ ted as a family planning meth@@ od, cannot be considered as a service which guarante@@ es sexual and reproductive health@@ '.
'@@ Se@@ af@@ aring cre@@ w@@ ' and '@@ Sch@@ i@@ ff@@ s@@ bes@@ at@@ z@@ ung@@ ' would have the additional advantage over the expression used in the German ver@@ sion, in that '@@ se@@ em@@ än@@ n@@ is@@ che@@ ' in German still has a very mas@@ cul@@ ine ring to it, whilst '@@ Sch@@ i@@ ff@@ s@@ bes@@ at@@ z@@ ung@@ ' and '@@ se@@ af@@ aring cre@@ w@@ ' could be said to be gen@@ der@@ -@@ neutr@@ al, which would have an advantage in terms of gender main@@ stream@@ ing.
The terms are '@@ political power@@ ' and '@@ reli@@ gious author@@ iti@@ es'.
The terms '@@ ligh@@ t' , '@@ ultr@@ a ligh@@ t' , '@@ low-@@ tar@@ ' and such lik@@ e, are in@@ correct.
'@@ WI@@ P@@ O Treat@@ y' should stand@@ , and the following four words plus the paren@@ thes@@ es must be del@@ et@@ ed.
The words '@@ traffic@@ king in human be@@ ing@@ s', '@@ sexual explo@@ it@@ ation' and '@@ forced pro@@ stitu@@ tion@@ ', at both national and global level, en@@ comp@@ ass the risk of a pandemic similar to that which poverty and hung@@ er have cre@@ ated, mainly in the developing countries, in the lower ec@@ hel@@ ons of these soci@@ e@@ ties.
The name of a ‘@@ Constitu@@ tional Treat@@ y@@ ’ desc@@ rib@@ es what it is perfec@@ t@@ ly: it has constitu@@ tional elements and it is an international treat@@ y.
The language is hardly suggestive of uniformly severe enforc@@ ement. Wor@@ ds like '@@ proportion@@ ate@@ ' and '@@ dis@@ su@@ as@@ iv@@ e' have been used.
The terms '@@ ve@@ al@@ ', '@@ ve@@ al me@@ at@@ ', or any other sales descri@@ ption defined in the proposal may no longer be used in the labelling of meat obtained from animals aged more than 12 months.
A@@ gricul@@ tural land has been affec@@ ted, including 75% of the pe@@ a cro@@ p in the UK.

The terrorists dr@@ agg@@ ed him over the as@@ phal@@ t into the j@@ ung@@ le, and nothing more was heard of him.
The g@@ un@@ men ti@@ ed him and his wife to a cha@@ ir and, as she ple@@ ad@@ ed for their lives, the B@@ rig@@ ade member told her@@ : ' His time has com@@ e' .
'S@@ of@@ tly, sof@@ t@@ ly@@ ' conc@@ iliation is merely ban@@ ked by the terrorist@@ s, who then demand more and more.
All the terrorists wanted to at@@ tain was cha@@ os and un@@ reason@@ ing reven@@ g@@ e.

Test@@ ing at 30 months remains the norm@@ , but will be kept under re@@ view.
the tests being applied should take into account the nuclear technology used at the power plan@@ t, which may include special characteristics that it h@@ as, without having to use test '@@ tem@@ plat@@ es@@ '@@ ;
There are hardly any clinical trials involving the testing of medicinal products on women.
Test@@ ing for BSE has been introduced for all healthy animals aged over 30 months and for at-@@ risk and cas@@ u@@ al@@ ty animals over 24 months.
Now that screening tests are compul@@ sor@@ y, is it necessary to go on destro@@ ying healthy animals or healthy parts of animal@@ s?
The stress tests proposed by the Commission will not be enough on their own to pac@@ ify the public.
Stre@@ ss tests are an essential supervisory tool for evalu@@ ating the specific solv@@ ency of individual banks and the ability of the system as a whole to with@@ stand stres@@ s.
Tox@@ icity tests are desirable and cannot be sk@@ ip@@ ped.
The tests should be concluded on 11 Nov@@ emb@@ er.
Test@@ s should be performed centr@@ ally on the most toxic substances in order to obtain reliable data, and these substances should be withdrawn from the market, in particular if they are carcinogenic or harmful to the reproductive system or other systems.
Test@@ ing must be reli@@ able, low-@@ cost and accessible to all patients, along with more effective diagnosis and treatment.
The so-called stress tests being prepared will only make sense and credi@@ bility in a cohes@@ ive Europe will only be re@@ stored if these stress tests are performed according to stringent criteria and not according to the weak criteria of the I@@ A@@ O, if genu@@ in@@ ely independent experts are consul@@ ted and if the events and the entire process is presented to the public in an appropriate and understand@@ able way.
The tests must allow us to better define the potential rec@@ ap@@ it@@ alisation needs of the banks and to take the measures that you have just mentioned.
Therefore, this assessment also covers the acute and long-term risks to honey be@@ es and their lar@@ v@@ ae and the tests applied are based on standards developed by inter@@ governmental organisations such as, for example, the European and Mediterranean Pl@@ ant Protection Organ@@ isation, in which 47 govern@@ ments collabor@@ ate.
Laboratory tests have confirmed that 14@@ % of the total number of ill people have contrac@@ ted the virus and it has claimed one victim@@ .
Scientific testing must be specific, in this case for children, and must be updat@@ ed.
The testing is paid for by the compan@@ y.
By testing to@@ ys, it can be indicated whether or not this '@@ acceptable daily in@@ tak@@ e' is exceeded in the case of humans.
F@@ ull and specific tests must be carried out on donated blood and plasma and we must be continu@@ ally informed of the existence and val@@ idity of new viral mark@@ ers.
Animal tests should only take place as an absolute necess@@ ity, and that is not happening in the case of cosme@@ tics.
K@@ ne@@ e-@@ j@@ er@@ k legisl@@ ation, however, is never warr@@ ant@@ ed.
O@@ ut@@ -@@ of-@@ date legislation can be repe@@ al@@ ed. Other legislation can be simpli@@ fied, and some can be m@@ erg@@ ed and consolid@@ ated.

The estimate for job creation is an average 1.3 new jobs per S@@ ME over 2 years which is described as substanti@@ al.
The estimate for the most likely error in cohes@@ ion sp@@ ending was significantly lower than in previous years, and for the budget as a whole, the Cour@@ t's estimate of errors has fallen over recent years.
The latest estimate puts the number of older people that have suffered abuse at over 10@@ %, which is a st@@ agg@@ ering fig@@ ure.
The official estimate of the number of prison@@ ers affected in this specific area and this specific inst@@ ance is 300@@ , rather than 7@@ 00@@ .
Human tissues and cells have become an important part of health care.
T@@ issues and cells are often acquired through cross-border ex@@ changes.
It is possible to store heat in all size categories for a day or a year, as opposed to what is stated in the Commission proposal and in certain committee opin@@ ions.
The storage of waste in re@@ pos@@ itor@@ ies, however, must in any case be performed in accordance with inter@@ nationally accepted safety standard@@ s, requirements and method@@ ology.
St@@ or@@ age of mercury in an abov@@ e-@@ ground fac@@ ility is therefore question@@ able in terms of safety and in terms of time (the amendments suggest that this storage would be tempor@@ ar@@ y).
The storage and disposal of such data is a crucial part of this safeguar@@ d.
There is no possibility of '@@ proportion@@ al@@ ity@@ ' and '@@ reci@@ proc@@ ity@@ ' in the case of bul@@ k data storage and transfer@@ , since it involves a series of un@@ control@@ l@@ able dang@@ ers, specifically relating to who has acc@@ ess, how the data are used and for what purpos@@ e.

There are obvious suspic@@ ions about the ho@@ ar@@ ding of meat and bon@@ eme@@ al and about where and how the testing is effec@@ ted.
The average supply of white sugar accounts for 14@@ % of the production quota of 2 million tonnes.
Estonia was most frequently used as an example and mention was also made of the Russian emb@@ arg@@ o on Polish meat products.
Estonia is particularly vulnerable to cy@@ ber attack@@ s, since it has an e-@@ cab@@ in@@ et and e-@@ government and this year had the first e-@@ elec@@ tions.

Tra@@ ffic@@ kers are also using Internet recruit@@ ment. This is very alarm@@ ing as many children have access to the Internet.
The traffic@@ kers know that information campaign@@ s are hardly likely to change the situ@@ ation, for studies have shown that most bu@@ y@@ ers are well aware of the higher concentration of harmful substances in these products and the risk of penal@@ ties being impos@@ ed.
Tr@@ ag@@ edi@@ es are not fair@@ ; almost al@@ ways, those who have the least are those who lose the mo@@ st.
The trag@@ edi@@ es suffered by Cy@@ p@@ rus during the last few weeks are the most serious it has known since 197@@ 4@@ ; they are the consequence of the ten@@ sion which has not ce@@ ased to increase along the 180 kilometres of the dem@@ arc@@ ation line.

Vaccines are an essential means of decis@@ ively comb@@ ating tubercul@@ osis, together with better testing for detection of infection that is reliable and low co@@ st, as well as more effective diagnosis and treatment.

To@@ day@@ 's vaccines are more adv@@ anc@@ ed.
The vaccines used hi@@ ther@@ to, which were those to which the af@@ ore@@ mentioned directive applied, led to the risk of transmission of the virus to un@@ vaccinated animals, which is the reason why vaccination was only allowed in specially designated zon@@ es.

These have seen a ra@@ is@@ ing, and thus a limit@@ ing, of the existing values to 40 and 70 ì@@ g/@@ l respectively.

The values for Spanish operators are as little as one two-@@ hund@@ red@@ th of the safe limit values.

The birth rates of the immigr@@ ant population are much higher than that of the in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous population.
The birth rate in EU countries remains low.
The average birth rate in the EU is 1.5 children, one of the lowest in the world@@ ; this can only be rever@@ sed with rob@@ ust policies in support of famili@@ es, which do not pen@@ alise men and women who decide to have children, in econom@@ ic, tax and professional term@@ s.
The average birth rate in women in the European Union is 1.@@ 5, which is too low to replace the current gener@@ ations.
The birth rate, on the other hand, goes down when the social position of women improv@@ es, when they receive an education and information on birth control@@ , and when they have their own means of ear@@ ning a li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood.
The level of nic@@ otine in dark tobacc@@ o, in particular, is higher than that of the other types of tobacco which would benefit from the transfer@@ .

The rate of inflation has fall@@ en.
The rate of inflation has long been the highest in the world.
The inflation rate in the euro area is at its highest level for 10 years.
The rate of inflation exceeded 20@@ %.
The rate of inflation is 0.3 of a percentage point above the 2% ce@@ il@@ ing.
The rate of inflation must be kept below 2% in the second half of the year. The t@@ elec@@ ommunic@@ ations, ma@@ il, energy and rail@@ way sectors must be liber@@ alised quickly and in a bal@@ anced manner.
The rate of inflation is also excep@@ tionally low@@ : 3.@@ 1 % in 1995.
In the last 12 months the average long-term interest rate has been 4.@@ 2%, which is below the reference value of 6.@@ 4@@ %.

Lo@@ ading time is of a supplementary nature and cannot be regarded as a significant part of working time, as the law does not appl@@ y, for instance, to journe@@ ys under 100 k@@ m.
All drivers are limited to driving times and associated work monitored by the tach@@ ograph@@ .
Driving time represents only half - on average - of the working time of a dri@@ ver.
The driving time we have stipul@@ ated – 90 hours in two weeks, but no more than 56 hours in a week – is still a considerable one.
On@@ -@@ call duty for fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ters, for example, need no longer be re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated.

Time is running out for habit@@ ats and for the bio@@ diversity of this plan@@ et.
The time referred to as inactive on-@@ call time does not count as working time, despite the fact that the employe@@ e is at the employ@@ er's dispos@@ al.
Meeting times will be limited and clear and conc@@ ise conclusions will be adop@@ ted.
Working time for long-@@ distance drivers must take account of the amount of time which is actually worked (un@@ load@@ ing, load@@ ing, break@@ s, et@@ ce@@ ter@@ a@@ )@@ ., it must very quickly come down to the 35@@ -@@ hour week and should never exceed 39 hours.
Working hours should be both shorter and, of course, more flex@@ ible.
Not only driving times, which are monitored using the tach@@ ograp@@ h, but also loading and un@@ loading times should now be considered as working time for every@@ one.
Working time is clearly part and par@@ ce@@ l of this process and needs to be monitored.
Working time will still be calculated over a 4 month period, with exemp@@ tions available to calcul@@ ate over 12-@@ months – subject to stronger control through collec@@ tive barg@@ ain@@ ing.
Nothing is more of a factor in stress and poor performance than excessively long hours of work.

The term '@@ gender main@@ stream@@ ing' occurs throughout the repor@@ t; what is that?
The term has to be incorpor@@ ated in all versions of the original Article 12.
Even the word '@@ abor@@ tion' has been almost totally eliminated from the Polish langu@@ age, and has been replaced by the expression '@@ killing of a conce@@ ived child@@ '.

The following is to be added to paragraph 20@@ :

This year@@ 's the@@ me, for instance, is the prevention, early detection and screening of breast and cervical cancer.
The them@@ e for the ex@@ hibition is man@@ kin@@ d, nature and technology.
The issue is as topical as it was before.
The topic is W@@ ik@@ i@@ Le@@ a@@ ks and cy@@ ber sec@@ urity.
E@@ th@@ ics has never been an exact sci@@ enc@@ e: it has always evol@@ ved with the level of human knowledg@@ e.

M@@ ov@@ ing on to labell@@ ing, in a free market it is not up to the legis@@ lat@@ or to decide what ingredients the manufacturer is to use.
Labelling will also help to improve public health in general and the environment.
Mark@@ ing of food is the alpha and om@@ eg@@ a.
Eg@@ g labelling will be mand@@ ator@@ y.
The product label should also provide consumers with clear and easily understand@@ able information about the correct way to administer the product.
The labelling of tobacco products other than cigarettes must be subject to the same conditions.
En@@ erg@@ y efficiency labelling must be standardis@@ ed in such a way that all consumers of any age, including children and the elder@@ ly, understand how much energy a piece of equipment consum@@ es.
Product labelling is one important way in which this mis@@ information can be coun@@ te@@ red.
Labelling products, however, will not provide the consumer with anything more than an indication that genetic technology was used in the production of the goods and the changes that its use has produced.
Labelling must therefore be perfect and not have the opposite of the intended effect.
Lab@@ els must be clear, and allergies must be taken into consider@@ ation, especially with products intended for children.
Labelling should tell consumers how to use vitamin and mineral products correc@@ tly.
Labelling must allow for accurate health mess@@ ages, such as for fol@@ ic acid.
Pr@@ ice mark@@ ing is a technolog@@ ically poor solution if each individual it@@ em is to be mark@@ ed, whereas price indication can be displayed on the ed@@ ge of a shel@@ f or in some other position.
E@@ co-@@ labelling on fisheries products states that they were produced in accordance with a specific series of environmental rules and that their method of production does not have adverse reperc@@ ussions on the environment.
Labelling is still an ill@@ us@@ ion.
C@@ lear@@ ly, labelling and rules must be the same for imported products too.
The un@@ differenti@@ ated labelling of tran@@ s fat@@ s will only conf@@ use consumers, create a negative image of healthy da@@ iry products and have undesirable effects on consump@@ tion, under@@ min@@ ing public health (@@ reduced intake of important nutri@@ ents such as calcium and proteins, for example@@ ).
Labelling has nothing to do with warning sign@@ s.
Lab@@ ell@@ ing, therefore, only sol@@ ves a small part of the problem.
Labelling is only an initial step.
Labelling or mark@@ ing should not be misleading and should be provided in such a way that the consumer can easily understand to which part of the product the particul@@ ars refer@@ .
Therefore, labelling enab@@ les those whose judg@@ ement diff@@ ers from mine to avoid products they ch@@ ose to rejec@@ t.
It is therefore perfectly possible to label properly, as the substance is always detec@@ table.
Labelling will also be applied to commercial and industrial energ@@ y-@@ using products, such as cold storage rooms or chil@@ led displa@@ y cab@@ in@@ ets.
Tra@@ ffic@@ -@@ light labelling is not representative as it only shows certain aspects in isol@@ ation, so it conf@@ uses consumers.
The label should contain information on the animal@@ ' s region of orig@@ in, where it is bor@@ n, fatten@@ ed up and slaugh@@ te@@ red.
The label must cover 30% of the pack@@ et surface, 35% if the wording is bil@@ ingu@@ al, and 12.@@ 5% of the outer surface of the w@@ rap@@ ping for pi@@ pe tobacc@@ o.
The label must be printed in black on a white background and the b@@ orders must be at least 3 mm and at most 4 mm w@@ ide, an average of 3.5 m@@ m.
The label on the product must be sufficiently larg@@ e.
The label only comes along when the for@@ k is po@@ is@@ ed; but the best solution would be to label when the pit@@ ch@@ for@@ k is po@@ ised.
It is approximately 30 metres deep on average and conditions are very difficul@@ t.
P@@ ig@@ eon sho@@ ot@@ ing is not a method of parliamentary monitor@@ ing.
A number of people were also seriously injured by the perpetr@@ at@@ or, who then turned his gun on him@@ sel@@ f.

The title of this call for research is ‘@@ Cap@@ ac@@ ity building for the conduct of phase I, II and III trials of vaginal micro@@ bic@@ ides against sexual transmission of HIV@@ ’.
The title of each line is the name of an In@@ stit@@ ute.
The title of the resolution may be the one which you have mention@@ ed, of course, but on the agenda it appears as '@@ Ho@@ olig@@ an@@ s' , within the section on human righ@@ ts.
The title of the report is not appropriate.
The title is signific@@ ant@@ : '@@ Health care and care for the elder@@ ly: Sup@@ port@@ ing national strategies for ensuring a high level of social protection@@ '.

This type of training certific@@ ate then has only limited valid@@ ity, with the result that the holder may only work in his particular specialised field.
The holder of a protection right may prevent the import@@ ation, by third parti@@ es, of products marketed without his author@@ iz@@ ation.
The be@@ are@@ r of a transportation permit must clearly be responsible for his load@@ .
The report is very def@@ en@@ sive in ton@@ e.
They are being over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by altern@@ ate feel@@ ings of surpris@@ e and disappoint@@ ment.
In a report in the Tor@@ onto Star, for example, it says that unless someone had managed to s@@ lip into a hospital to see a SAR@@ S patient in quar@@ antine it was totally idi@@ otic to claim that anyone had caught an infectious disease in Can@@ ad@@ a.
The total allow@@ able catch for this year has been reduced to 13 500 tonnes.
The Total Al@@ low@@ able Cat@@ ch for ha@@ ke is divided up into four administrative areas.
The total number of du@@ plic@@ ations therefore represents around 5% of the total number of registered vo@@ ters.
Total Community imports from Can@@ ada increased by 12% in 200@@ 6, compared with the reference period 2000@@ -@@ 2005 and 7% in 200@@ 7@@ ; in the case of the United States imports increased by 27@@ % in 2006 and 26@@ % in 2007 versus the same reference period.
Sum@@ mer touris@@ m would not alone be able to permanently maintain life along our coast@@ lin@@ es.
It is a way of crossing border@@ s: if you go to the Al@@ gar@@ ve, you fall in lo@@ ve with Portu@@ gal@@ ; if you go to the March@@ e, you fall in lo@@ ve with Ital@@ y; if you go to the Co@@ sta del Sol@@ , you might fall in lo@@ ve with Spain, and if you go to Pro@@ v@@ ence, you fall in lo@@ ve with France.
T@@ ouris@@ m and agriculture have a particular problem because of different working pattern@@ s and because of the times of year that they work.
For@@ um shop@@ ping and the '@@ d@@ ash to cour@@ t@@ ', for one party to obtain a favourable result, are serious side-effects of this.
The term '@@ touris@@ m@@ ' must no longer be solely per@@ ce@@ ived as sy@@ non@@ ym@@ ous with sun@@ , sea and holid@@ ay@@ s, which has the effect of reducing the interest taken in the subject at institutional level.
It cannot be denied that ‘@@ gas@@ ol@@ ine touris@@ m@@ ’ is common@@ place now@@ ad@@ ay@@ s, and it is par@@ tly responsible for the damage to the environment.
T@@ ouris@@ m can also be a factor causing disturbance and leading to ab@@ use.
T@@ ouris@@ m may be a significant driving force for the development of a poor country.
The change of attitude by the Member States thus indicates the da@@ wning of a new period of co-@@ operation between the European Union and Ar@@ men@@ ia.
All this under the provis@@ o that it does not lead to the weak@@ ening of existing protec@@ tion.
All this is done in a cl@@ an@@ dest@@ ine way, since it is not made clear that these are promo@@ tional vide@@ os.
The issue is now whether or not that patient should get authorisation from the authorities in his own country before going ab@@ road for treatment.
The point is how to prevent disast@@ ers like the one which happened in the Stra@@ it of K@@ er@@ ch.
The '@@ all-@@ drug@@ ' approach has revealed its limit@@ ations with the increasing levels of resistance to antibiotics and vaccin@@ es.
Prime among them is the sti@@ p@@ ulation that they should only be used for a limited period and for a very specific purpos@@ e, to ensure that no possible residues from such products could remain within meat or other products which event@@ ually are sold for human consumption.
All this has been dre@@ dg@@ ed up and '@@ moder@@ n@@ is@@ ed@@ ' to su@@ it the new digital age of multi@@ media conver@@ gence and the ex@@ traordinary spread of the Internet.

At the same time, the train has proved the European Union right, namely that more competition keep@@ s you on your to@@ es and on the b@@ all.
The Treaty was rati@@ fied by the Se@@ j@@ m and by the Sen@@ ate.
The treaty was voted against and is therefore dead@@ .

The treatment of classified information has to be carefully considered.
The separate treatment of by-@@ products, fat@@ s and domestic ref@@ use is likely to consolid@@ ate the desired safety objec@@ tive.
Therefore the treatment must be long-term as well and it will require pati@@ ence.
Ch@@ oler@@ a treatment is simple@@ , but early access to treatment is key to limiting fat@@ al@@ ities.
The way the dos@@ si@@ er on the recovery of c@@ od and ha@@ ke stocks has been handled is typical of an in@@ war@@ d-@@ looking approach by the Commission which mis@@ diagno@@ ses the situation because it is cut off from reality and thus makes poor decisions.
The equal treatment of men and women also tou@@ ches the heart of the Union's values.

A risk assessment of these factors has revealed that the circumstances which can cause such a high incidence of the disease, and also a high preval@@ ence of scrap@@ ie - a change in the method of processing carc@@ asses and a high proportion of meat and bone meal in feed - exist to this extent only in the UK.
Risk evaluation of long-term effects has been en@@ sh@@ rin@@ ed, as has the possibility for Member States to set additional requirements for environment@@ ally sensitive areas.
There would have to be a tho@@ rough evaluation of the risks involved, and that would have to extend to an assessment of possible delayed effects.
Risk assessment has to be undertaken by those who are qualified and expert in that area - that is the scienti@@ sts.
Risk assessments have sho@@ wn, as Mrs R@@ ies has just said, that the use of pent@@ ab@@ ro@@ modi@@ phen@@ yl ether carries risks for the environment and public health, because this bro@@ m@@ ide@@ -@@ bas@@ ed, flame retard@@ ant agent is used in the production of fur@@ nit@@ ure and u@@ ph@@ ol@@ ster@@ y.
The risk assessment carried out examined in particular the toxic and aller@@ genic potential of the introduced genes and it was concluded that there was no reasons to believe there would be any adverse effects on human health in the environment from the introduction into soya be@@ ans of the genes cod@@ ing for gl@@ ys@@ oph@@ ate tolerance and the chloro@@ pl@@ ast transi@@ t pepti@@ de.
The review of all of the material which is to take place in order to finally clar@@ ify the position of the European Research Council should be fixed to take place in 2008.
The evaluation carried out is relevant from several points of view.

The review merely expres@@ ses concern that progress is not being made as quickly as envisaged in the time@@ tab@@ les.
The app@@ ra@@ is@@ al carried out on both of these kin@@ ds of issues cannot be reduced to specific for or against positions being taken in Parliament regarding the French decision.

There must be diversity in the range of rural occu@@ pati@@ ons, and the country@@ side has to be developed with respect for nature and rec@@ re@@ ation.

The wind b@@ lowing from the other side of the Atlantic does not au@@ gu@@ r well and the growth forecast@@ s for 2008 are lower than we might have hop@@ ed.
The possibility that invest@@ ments may be delayed in certain regions means there may be a pol@@ ari@@ zation between those who have information and those who do not.
The possible impact on touris@@ m should also be set against the overall trend of a very strong growth in touris@@ m demand.

HIV/@@ AIDS involves medicines which are pric@@ ed way above the potential of the po@@ o@@ rest and most vulner@@ able.
HIV, tuberculosis and mal@@ aria are the world@@ 's greatest kill@@ ers and are the most serious diseases affecting the world today.
HIV/@@ A@@ ids has had a devast@@ ating effect on the country, with one in five adults being HIV positive and over one@@  million children orph@@ an@@ ed through the loss of their parents from A@@ ids.
HIV/@@ AIDS also causes malnutrition and star@@ v@@ ation, for a rural population which is sick cannot cultiv@@ ate its fiel@@ ds, or can only do so to a limited ext@@ ent.
HIV/@@ AIDS is closely linked with mal@@ aria and tubercul@@ osis, which are also pover@@ ty@@ -related infectious diseases.

Wine goes hand@@ -in-@@ hand with cu@@ is@@ ine; it is the mark of the region where it was produc@@ ed, it carries the flav@@ our of the cultiv@@ ated soil and it is the symbol of f@@ es@@ tivity and of living together.
Wine does have a beneficial effect on health, and should be considered as a food.
In Europe, wine is not water plus chemicals plus flavour@@ ings, as it is in the self-@@ st@@ yl@@ ed win@@ er@@ ies of Cal@@ i@@ for@@ nia or Au@@ str@@ al@@ ia, but a food produced from fer@@ ment@@ ed grap@@ es.
Bl@@ ended wine is not ros@@ é@@ ; it is a mixed whit@@ e.
Buc@@ k@@ fast wine shoul@@ d, ap@@ paren@@ tly, be banned because it contains both alcohol and ca@@ ffe@@ ine.
P@@ ort wine and Ro@@ qu@@ e@@ for@@ t che@@ ese are European products that set the standard around the world.
Wine must remain at a minimum rate of exc@@ ise du@@ ty, a zero rate, and must be tax@@ ed by volu@@ me.
Wine is a grap@@ e product, not a sugar be@@ et product.
Wine is a food, a ton@@ ic@@ ; it so@@ oth@@ es the nerv@@ es, a@@ ids diges@@ tion, is anti-@@ aller@@ genic and can act as an effective preventive against vascular diseases, cancer and dementia.
Wine is an agricultural product, made once a year.
Wine is a fer@@ ment@@ ed product, not a mixed product.
Wine is a natural product which, taken regularly and in moder@@ ation, is beneficial to health.
The tw@@ enti@@ eth century was tur@@ bul@@ ent and exc@@ it@@ ing: it sp@@ an@@ ned three epo@@ ch@@ s, from pe@@ as@@ ant society to the industrial and post-@@ industrial er@@ a, and went even further in its final dec@@ ade.
Wine does not contain fat or sugar but alcohol, which is already grad@@ ed in current labell@@ ing.

Has the virus attacked man@@ ?
The avian flu virus is sel@@ dom transmitted from birds to human@@ s; however, the WHO has reported 18@@ 5 cases of this infection and 104 deaths in the period from 2003 to March 2006.
The influenza virus is an RNA virus containing eight gen@@ es.
Not only is the virus highly communic@@ able, but the delay yet again in providing the relevant information has helped it to spread@@ .
The virus does not survive at a temperature of more than 26@@ º C, and is therefore not dangerous to humans.
The virus can travel with retur@@ ning play@@ ers and f@@ ans in food and on their foot@@ we@@ ar.
The virus, which is transmitted by mos@@ qu@@ it@@ os, has now already infected 200@@  000 of the 7@@ 60@@  000 inhabitants of the island of R@@ é@@ union and is thought to be directly responsible for the deaths of five people.
It appears to be resistant to treatment by antibiotics, to have a variable development and not necessarily to follow the course one would expect in terms of the vulner@@ ability of the patients concerned.
The virus is spread 90% through sexual contact and 10% through drug use.
The virus harm@@ s col@@ d-@@ blood@@ ed animals.

Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ering is a gr@@ at@@ u@@ it@@ ous and un@@ paid activity, but this does not mean that it does not generate any costs.
It is something that is done out of the free will of the person concerned and can have an incre@@ di@@ b@@ ly positive impact on the lives of man@@ y.
There is also a dram@@ atic increase in the amount of wast@@ e, which can result in the destruction of natural areas and to over-@@ explo@@ it@@ ation.
The volume of fine dust will increase dram@@ aticall@@ y.
The volume of what has been agreed on corresponds to about 2% of global OD@@ A - not a big de@@ al.
The mass@@ es of humanitarian aid, including food, seem to be a drop in the oc@@ ean for the people who are desper@@ ately in need.
There has been a dimin@@ ution in the amount of research and development and that is a sha@@ me.
So the volume on voice has gone up tre@@ mend@@ ously, by 34@@ % in one year only.
Emp@@ loy@@ ment is rising - it has risen during the last year - but only very in@@ significantly.
S@@ l@@ ur@@ ry could be contained on the farm and could be changed into bi@@ og@@ as, and the waste from that could then be spread on the land.
The authorised catch volume is set at 4 600 tonnes, slightly above the previous agre@@ ement@@ ' s 4 500 tonnes but quite a long way below the historical levels of 198@@ 8 to 199@@ 4 of 6 000 tonnes.
The volume of waste is increasing and most of it is dump@@ ed in land@@ fill@@ s.
The volume of toxic waste is continu@@ ously increasing in the EU.
So much "@@ Sp@@ am@@ " em@@ a@@ il is s@@ ent.
The volume of co@@ ins containing nick@@ el will fall to 8 % compared with 75 % at the mom@@ ent.

The total volume and range of mut@@ u@@ ally-@@ trad@@ ed products must be monitored and assessed closely and in a coordinated mann@@ er, together with their cer@@ ti@@ fied quality and ver@@ ifi@@ able place of origin.

Ac@@ qu@@ ired experience should determine the future.
Experience has shown that there are currently few or no good mechanisms for dialogue in spor@@ t.
Furthermore, experience has shown that different interpre@@ t@@ ations of the tex@@ ts could lead to situations where the general public is exposed to dis@@ gu@@ ised advertis@@ ing, especially on the Internet.
The experience was a good one.
Long experience has shown that rapidly changing market conditions and constant over-@@ bud@@ g@@ eting have affected appropri@@ ations for agricultural expenditure from year to year.
Experience has demonstrated that these measures are wrong@@ ly or un@@ equally applied since they are amb@@ igu@@ ous or in@@ complete, or can no longer be applied due to changes in the sector.

Pakist@@ an's experience of democracy in the past 60 years has been trou@@ ble@@ d.
I know from my own country, Sweden, where breast@@ -@@ screening has been available for many years to women in certain age groups, that such screening has reduced the death rate amongst women and that it is important to detect the disease early in order to provide the right treatment.
The experience from my own country shows me that national bureaucrac@@ ies are un@@ believ@@ ably obstruc@@ tive, and st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist all changes that would limit their ability to victim@@ ise small business@@ es.
Experience has shown that total g@@ rubb@@ ing@@ -up oper@@ ations, such as those carried out in 1990@@ -@@ 1993 and 199@@ 4-@@ 199@@ 5, are of limited effectiveness and more difficult to monit@@ or, since they require complete information about and total control over the fruit or@@ ch@@ ards of applic@@ ants.

Experience with such advice centres in Sweden - as well as in Ireland and Spain - has shown that specific advice is especially important in the star@@ t@@ up phas@@ e, and that the dissemination of positive experiences has an encouraging and motiv@@ ating effect.
Experience in this field and the instruments that the European Union has at its disposal must be better coordinated and used more effectively.
In this respec@@ t, IB@@ IS (@@ In@@ stit@@ ut B@@ il@@ ing@@ ue Inter@@ univer@@ sit@@ a@@ ire de la Se@@ ine@@ ), which first saw the light of day in H@@ au@@ te@@ -@@ Nor@@ man@@ di@@ e, is most ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary.

P@@ ast experience has shown us what we have coming to us if these criteria are not met.
The United Kingdom experience was so rapid that the large loss of jobs and the difficulties associated with un@@ b@@ und@@ ling came over far too short a period.
The UK experience shows that it is possible to have a competitive industry, but that the adjustment process can be t@@ ough and painf@@ ul@@ .
So did the R@@ w@@ and@@ an experience.
Experience in Europe has shown that this wat@@ ering down simply results in a shift to pre@@ car@@ ious working conditions and does not create new job@@ s.
S@@ pain@@ ' s experience over the last four years has demonstrated that jobs are indeed created but are predominantly cas@@ ual and pre@@ car@@ ious in nat@@ ure, and they are associated with a high rate of industrial accid@@ ents, the M@@ ur@@ ci@@ a region being the part of Spain where that rate is h@@ ig@@ he@@ st.
It is in individual work@@ places that experience is gain@@ ed.
Since this has been a positive experienc@@ e, it is not enough now just to top it up or make a few adjust@@ ments.
Experience and performance are both important here.
Experience in a number of countries has shown that Europe can still have beauti@@ ful@@ , good@@ -@@ quality colour@@ s even with fewer solvent@@ s.
Experience in Luxembourg has shown that nothing is achieved by inv@@ iting voluntary contribu@@ tions.
Experience has shown that declar@@ ations and re@@ solu@@ tions, however strong@@ ly wor@@ ded, get no@@ where.
Ad@@ mit@@ ted@@ ly, experience shows that there is not always a stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward proportion@@ ate link between the extent of the aid and the results in the shape of development.
Experience in general shows that State aid is too widely used for protection@@ ist reasons.
Experience fortun@@ ately shows that the fun@@ d can be used by any@@ one, regardless of whether a large or small country or a large or small firm is involved and this was our original inten@@ tion.
Experience shows that in the United Kingdom such a rise in wind speed could increase stor@@ m damage by 50@@ %, and in the Netherlands a 6% rise in wind speed could result in damage increasing fiv@@ e@@ fol@@ d, because of the li@@ ability of flood@@ ing.
Experience shows that we receive over two times more requests to speak than we can accept in view of the time available.
Experience shows that languages which are used more widely and in a more econom@@ ically active way '@@ de@@ v@@ our@@ ' small ones.
Experience shows that the forecast@@ s published by the Commission - both the macro@@ economic and the f@@ isc@@ al figures - are not bi@@ ased and are at least as reliable as those of other forecast@@ ers.
Experience shows that such transfer systems have a bad effect on long-term growth.
Experience will show how successfully these criteria are me@@ t, but what will happen n@@ ext?
Experience has not brought any major problems to light.
Experience is a bon@@ us@@ ; it cannot be a defec@@ t.
Hist@@ oric@@ ally, of course, for species such as car@@ p, tro@@ ut and so on, there proved to be no reperc@@ ussions in the areas in which they were releas@@ ed.
P@@ ast experience has shown that a few problems may yet emerge.
Experience shows that at best 15% to 20% of the losses can be rec@@ overed.
When public transport is organised first of all it is, after some initial loss, later more than adequately rec@@ ou@@ ped.
Experience indicated that the no@@ tific@@ ations of 1 March did not include all of the accurate data required in order to provide a sufficient picture of how the previous budgetary year had been con@@ clu@@ ded.
We know from experience that that is a bad method which only causes complications.
Experience suggests that non-@@ payment difficulties do not generally aris@@ e.
Experience has also proved that it is always easy for Parliament to let off ste@@ am in the first part of the resolution before no@@ d@@ ding off in the second par@@ t.
Experience shows that closing b@@ orders serv@@ es only to force immigrants with no identity pap@@ ers and no rights into the hands of smuggl@@ ers and other un@@ sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ous deal@@ ers.
The experience we are gain@@ ing is too expen@@ sive, but is very instruc@@ tive.
Rec@@ ent experience has highligh@@ ted, as well as remin@@ ding those who had forgot@@ ten, that remot@@ eness and a lack of transparency lead to ir@@ responsible behaviour and fraud@@ .
The explanation given was that it was a very dangerous area.

The use of child soldiers and sexual assa@@ ults on S@@ r@@ i L@@ ank@@ an women is en@@ dem@@ ic.
Ex@@ p@@ lo@@ itation and illegal activities cannot be tolerated at all in any form.
O@@ ff@@ sh@@ ore oil dr@@ illing expl@@ oration has increased exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally and the risks have therefore increased al@@ so, but safety, on the other hand, remains largely inadequate.
Scot@@ tish oil expl@@ oration has not been without incident and the Pi@@ per Al@@ pha catastroph@@ e showed that some prices are too high in the pursu@@ it of o@@ il.
The explo@@ sion in broad@@ casting technologies has caused many parents to lose control over what their children wat@@ ch, and the growth of dig@@ it@@ al, c@@ able and sat@@ ellite T@@ V, as well as home computer technology, means that parents are increasingly power@@ less to monitor their children's view@@ ing habit@@ s.
There was an explo@@ sion in a fire@@ works wa@@ re@@ house which has already caused at least six@@ teen deaths and has injured over six hundred people, six of whom are in a critical condi@@ tion, with many more people reported mis@@ sing.
The expor@@ ter must prove this.
The expor@@ ter is required, for a period of a minimum of five years, to keep a record of the notification and the acknowledg@@ ement of rece@@ ip@@ t from the competent authority of the import@@ ing country.
The export@@ ing of these values was often accompanied by viol@@ ence.
The export of metal@@ lic mercury should be bann@@ ed.
Ex@@ port@@ s, mean@@ while, are enhanced by means of export subsidi@@ es, which make it possible to export a di@@ verse range of products in their original state, or sometimes as highly processed star@@ ch products.
The explan@@ atory statement clearly records that "@@ no agreement was reach@@ ed@@ " between Member States, that there was "@@ considerable opposition in the Council@@ " and that there was rejection by "@@ business@@ ".
There is also a clear difference in the set@@ -up of the test.
Ex@@ po@@ sure to these chemicals can lead to ti@@ redness, nausea, palpit@@ ations, and other symptoms. Long-term exposure can lead to irreversible damage to the nervous system, which can man@@ if@@ est itself as for@@ get@@ ful@@ ness, concentration disorders and even loss of identity - in other words, the organic psych@@ os@@ yn@@ dro@@ me, OP@@ S.
Ex@@ po@@ sure to these substances can result in damage to brain functioning and ultimately to dis@@ able@@ ment.
Ex@@ po@@ sure to asbe@@ sto@@ s can cause serious illness@@ es, such as ple@@ ural and lung fibrosis and cancer of the lung@@ , ple@@ ura or perit@@ one@@ um.
Benz@@ ene exposure occurs for example in oil refin@@ eri@@ es, in connection with petro@@ l transport and distribution, that is at service stations and gar@@ ages, and in the petro@@ chemical industry.
Ex@@ po@@ sure to a 1 p@@ p@@ m concentration of benz@@ ene over a complete working life causes up to 6.@@ 5 additional cases of leukaemia per thousand work@@ ers.
The exposure to risk and the way in which those toys are used are not, in fact, the same.
Thus exposure to the sun is a known risk, for example to the agriculture and building industri@@ es, and is already sufficiently cat@@ ered for.
Ex@@ po@@ sure to these reactions may take place by breathing, by ing@@ est@@ ing food, by absorption through the skin, or direc@@ tly, as happens with radi@@ ation.
Ex@@ po@@ sure to pesticides can also increase the risk of asthma in children.
Ex@@ po@@ sure to solvents can have serious consequenc@@ es, such as mem@@ ory loss, loss of concentration and premature dementia.
Ex@@ po@@ sure must also be taken into consideration because with pestic@@ ides, like many things in life, it is the dosage that cre@@ ates the po@@ ison haz@@ ard.
Human exposure must be restricted to an absolute minim@@ um.
The ex@@ hibi@@ tion, entitled '@@ A story with a fut@@ ure@@ ' will be form@@ ally opened at 2.@@ 45 p.m. this after@@ no@@ on in the Vis@@ itor@@ s' area on the ground floor of the Lou@@ ise We@@ is@@ s build@@ ing.

The term ‘@@ human capit@@ a@@ ’ has always struc@@ k me as a rather du@@ bi@@ ous one.
The term '@@ therapeutic cl@@ one@@ ' is a form of misleading packaging.

The C@@ air@@ o con@@ ference term '@@ reproductive health@@ ' was defined by the World Health Organisation as including the term '@@ fertility regul@@ ation' which includes the term '@@ interrup@@ ting unwanted pregnanc@@ y@@ ', i.e. abor@@ tion.
The expression of diver@@ g@@ ent interests has resulted in a rather sha@@ ky overall construction that contains certain in@@ consist@@ encies, or even contradic@@ tions.
The phrase "@@ human righ@@ ts@@ " in English does not have a gender specific con@@ no@@ tation in same way as in Fren@@ ch.
That sentence is ne@@ o-@@ colon@@ i@@ alist - as if those countries did not know what they were do@@ ing, did not know what their potential was@@ !
‘@@ Par@@ as@@ itic cop@@ ies@@ ’ is therefore the correct wor@@ ding.
For me, that is a mis@@ nom@@ er and I would have preferred something like '@@ subst@@ and@@ ard@@ ' ship@@ s.
The expression '@@ ' is a later adap@@ tation of what P@@ lin@@ y actually w@@ rot@@ e.
The phrase '@@ just a house@@ w@@ ife@@ ' needs to be out@@ law@@ ed.
The phrase "@@ free and fair@@ " should be avo@@ ide@@ d: it is loaded voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary which is always ru@@ th@@ less@@ ly targ@@ eted by the media in any post-@@ election circumstances.
The new expression '@@ har@@ ass@@ ment at work@@ ' is foun@@ ded on the old explo@@ it@@ ative relation@@ ship@@ s.
The expression ‘@@ shall ha@@ ve@@ ' must be interpre@@ ted to mean that the issue of a work permit cannot be denied if the persons concerned have already obtained the right to long-term resid@@ ence.
The term '@@ politically neutr@@ al' would be far more acceptable.
The term '@@ practition@@ er@@ ' is used throughout the proposal to describe the person who is responsible for the medical exposure.
The term '@@ own@@ -@@ initiative report@@ ' is not quite accur@@ ate.
The word alone gives rise to a whole range of discre@@ p@@ anc@@ ies.
The expression '@@ final vot@@ e' does not determine the type of vot@@ e, but indicates the last vote on a subject@@ .'
Ex@@ pul@@ sion is strictly individual and never collec@@ tive, and is accompanied by the guaranteed right to a def@@ ence.
The E@@ c@@ stas@@ y taken by young Europeans in Amster@@ dam or in Par@@ is is just as harmful as the gl@@ ue s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ed by street children in Ri@@ o or Mex@@ ic@@ o C@@ ity.
The time extension was grant@@ ed, provided that the competent authorities adjust the air quality plan to include short-term measures that are effective for control@@ ling and, where necessary, sus@@ pend@@ ing activities that contribute to the risk of the limit values being exce@@ e@@ ded.

The extension of marketing authorisations under other names has been expres@@ s@@ ly simpli@@ fied.
The extension of bio@@ degrad@@ ability testing to all substances and preparations at this stage would be a disproportion@@ ate and un@@ justifi@@ able measure.
Ex@@ t@@ ending the scope of the authorisation procedure (@@ paragraph 38@@ ) is also un@@ feas@@ ible@@ : in order to avoid an un@@ manag@@ eable situ@@ ation, we call@@ , in Amendment No 6@@ 8, for substances for which there is no proof of toxicity to be excluded.

Harmon@@ y in diversity was possible, and there could only be zero tolerance for intoler@@ ance.
Harmonisation of these forms of complement@@ ary protection must not of course be an end in itself ei@@ ther.
Harmonisation of tax b@@ ases has very different effects in the different countries depending on differences in the structure of their industri@@ es.
Harmonisation of standards should result in a high level of protection throughout the EU and should not be based on the lowest common den@@ omin@@ ator.
This is therefore not about harmon@@ ising driving times.
Harmonisation of the market will produce win@@ ners and los@@ ers.
Harmonisation of the 35@@ :@@ 65 ratio in other fisheries agreements will be introduced in 2006.
Harmonisation is necessary mainly because of the risk to public health which ar@@ ises through Member States applying varying sets of scientific criteria when evalu@@ ating changes to medicinal products.

The Question Time in Rome was certainly anim@@ ated, as points 6 and 26 state and which is all too comm@@ end@@ able, but as it is actually mentioned tw@@ ice, one gets the impression that this is an altogether unusual exception to the rule and that the basic nature of our work is lif@@ eless and anaem@@ ic.

The il@@ log@@ ic@@ ality and ir@@ responsibility of this report do not end there.
The im@@ age, often presented in adver@@ ti@@ se@@ ments, of how young women should look - all s@@ li@@ m wa@@ ists and large breast@@ s - means that there is a considerable increase in the number of breast implants carried out on very young women.
I have always preferred the image of a European family to that of a European hou@@ se, because the idea of building a house always suggests a building site, dra@@ ugh@@ ty, full of rub@@ ble and not very comfor@@ table.

That innov@@ ation does not come about by hand@@ ing out extr@@ as to the pharmaceutical companies.
Inno@@ vation is not inven@@ tion.
Inno@@ vation will not come from din@@ os@@ aur@@ s.
Inno@@ vation may result in the development and re@@ inven@@ tion of the European Union once the current crisis is over.
Inno@@ vation also shows in new approach@@ es, new methods and new ment@@ al@@ ities.
The concern that emerg@@ es from this is that we are selling the European brand as if we were selling a can of Coc@@ a-@@ Col@@ a or a pa@@ ir of sho@@ es.

There is enormous concern among the citizen@@ r@@ y.
The concern is for next w@@ inter@@ .
This was a very difficult matter and there is no doubt that you handled it very well.
Wor@@ ries about price increases proved to be more or less un@@ justi@@ fied.
The principal concern is the risk of explo@@ it@@ ation.
The wor@@ ry such as that for the lad@@ y of R@@ ang@@ o@@ on is a genuine one.
The entry on the regist@@ er, the decision that finally clos@@ es the complain@@ t as well as any report or recommendations to the European Parliament will be made an@@ on@@ ym@@ ous so that the complain@@ ant cannot be identi@@ fied.
The inclusion of an '@@ employment chap@@ ter@@ ' in the new treaty will help.
I will list four of them.
There is acute social insec@@ urity.
Ar@@ tific@@ ial in@@ semin@@ ation and embryo transfer provide for that.
The inclusion of this data in passp@@ orts gives a false sense of security as it does not prevent a child from crossing a border without paren@@ tal cons@@ ent.
The Chi@@ ef Inspec@@ tor recommended that the high-@@ level waste tanks and the serious risk resulting from the in@@ ability of B@@ N@@ F@@ L to make them p@@ assi@@ vely safe through vit@@ ri@@ fication was an urgent issue.
Their inspection was carried out under its aus@@ pic@@ es.
When the UN inspec@@ ted the damage, only the school and the mos@@ que were still stand@@ ing.
The N@@ II would like to see the minimisation of the amount of high-@@ level liquid waste stored in order to reduce the potential haz@@ ard.
These have been welcom@@ ed both by the inspec@@ torate and by the mini@@ ster responsib@@ le.
There has been a rise in inst@@ ability.
The present inst@@ ability and violence cannot and must not continue in@@ definit@@ ely.
The inst@@ ability and in@@ justice that were condemned both at D@@ av@@ os and Por@@ to A@@ le@@ gr@@ e are one of the consequences of the effectiveness of this market capit@@ alism.
The implementation of such safety systems in all vehicles will come into effect from 2006 on@@ wards.

The Commission's anti@@ -f@@ ra@@ ud un@@ it, UC@@ L@@ AF@@ , has passed its initial test and achieved some success@@ es.
The creation of such a for@@ um can only be the first step.
The institution that you will be pre@@ si@@ ding over must achieve this tr@@ ust@@ .
The institution in question is usually given three months to comment on the complain@@ t. This time limit is mentioned in the stat@@ ute.
The MA@@ RI@@ N Institute in the Netherlands found the main reasons for container st@@ ack collap@@ ses were faul@@ ty l@@ ash@@ ings, overweight containers and faul@@ ty sto@@ w@@ age.

Eur@@ atom lo@@ ans were first set up in 197@@ 7, and the amount has since been increased five times.
The mechanism - the Gener@@ alised System of Pre@@ fe@@ rences - exists and could still be used. However, it is not being used, or at least it is not being used suffici@@ ently.
The up@@ rising in this country, following on from Tun@@ is@@ ia and Egyp@@ t, has been blo@@ odi@@ er and has taken a tragic turn@@ .
The rising is spreading and moving nor@@ th@@ wards.
The entire drop in the market value is therefore passed on to small farmers and plant@@ ation workers, so much so that consumers in developed countries do not even see a drop in the price of their cup of coffe@@ e.
The whole interpretation has been made available for your inspec@@ tion.
The entire text has already been the subject of overall read@@ ing in the working part@@ y. It has also been examined by the Article 36 Committee and is now before the CO@@ RE@@ P@@ ER@@ .
Integr@@ ation has therefore re@@ located from the batt@@ le@@ field to the con@@ ference h@@ all.
EU integration is like a t@@ ang@@ o.
In@@ corpor@@ ating disability access at the produc@@ t-@@ design stage is cost-@@ neutral or ad@@ ds at most 2-@@ 5 % to overall cost@@ s, whereas creating a separate specialist product and market is expen@@ sive.
The incorpor@@ ation of women into the workplace is a reality which cannot be rever@@ sed and women cannot be put in a situation of having to ch@@ ose between having children and keeping their job because of the complications which a pregnancy may entail@@ .
It is also essential for the functioning of health@@ y, hum@@ ane democrac@@ ies.
It is also useful to extend the monitoring system to include an@@ thro@@ po@@ genic emissions and reduc@@ tions.
Integr@@ ation in the first place has to start with development.
Integr@@ ation is a two-@@ way process.
The further phas@@ ing-@@ in of the new Member States is reflected in all the internal head@@ ings, with particularly shar@@ p increases in structural – up to 30% – and rural development policies – up to 9@@ %.
It is also of significant help to those who subsequently return home.
Integr@@ ation in this area can for that reason only be achieved by means of co@@ er@@ ci@@ on.
Ra@@ dic@@ al Islamic fundament@@ alism, though non-@@ viol@@ ent, is also on the increase in a number of countries.
The integr@@ ity of these rules will be tested by attempts to dil@@ ute them for national reasons.
Integr@@ ity of ce@@ me@@ ter@@ ies is not a case to accep@@ t.
The sur@@ ge in sed@@ entary occu@@ pati@@ ons, the increase in car@@ s, the reduction in exercise and the increasing consumption of food and drink with high energy content are causing significant health problems for our citizen@@ s.
This intensi@@ fication has a significant environmental impact and margin@@ alis@@ es less productive loc@@ ations.
The intensity of the feeling is of course mainly attributable to the fact that most of the victims were children.
The intention is la@@ ud@@ able, but the reasons behind it exagg@@ erated and the result out of propor@@ tion.
The intention is that the Commission should review the use of additives E 4@@ 32 to E 4@@ 36 (@@ that is, polys@@ or@@ bat@@ es), E 25@@ 1, E 25@@ 2, and E 24@@ 9 to E 250 (which are nit@@ rates and nit@@ rit@@ es) and that, before 1 July 200@@ 4, the conditions of use for par@@ ab@@ en@@ s, from E 2@@ 14 to E 2@@ 19, should be revis@@ ed.
The intention was to am@@ end the rules that currently require all feed materials in a compound feeding@@ st@@ u@@ ff to be indicated with a declar@@ ation of percentage by weight.
The reference was clearly intended to place that fel@@ low@@ ship within a pe@@ j@@ or@@ ative cont@@ ex@@ t.
The intention was for the new system to come into operation in 2005.
It has never been the intention to protect the sector on the basis of impro@@ per argum@@ ents.
The intention is not to question the basic ideas of these conven@@ tions, only to ensure that they are no longer used by ill-@@ inten@@ tioned people.
Gen@@ e-@@ environment interaction and cancer development will also cover lifestyle and other major risk fact@@ ors.
Inter@@ connection is not just developed by one Member Stat@@ e: you need at least two for this.
M@@ ut@@ ual depend@@ ence is a good thing for Russi@@ a and the EU, as long as it is exercised in the right way.
The inter@@ depend@@ ency and inter@@ connec@@ ted@@ ness of our existence with other forms of life on the plan@@ et is ne@@ gl@@ ec@@ ted, under@@ valued and played down.
Inter@@ depend@@ ence requires that diver@@ sities are taken into accoun@@ t, where possible, in the transition from pl@@ ur@@ ality to un@@ ity, and it must be regulated by maintaining a balance in the relationship between the identi@@ ties, diver@@ sities and co-@@ existence of the mod@@ els.
The ban on ga@@ ther@@ ings and demonstr@@ ations has also been lif@@ ted, except for several areas in Har@@ are.
The substance of the British ban is that such meal and such feed must not be given to any farm anim@@ al, so pigs and other livestock must not be fed with it.
The ban on factory ships such as the ‘@@ Atlantic D@@ a@@ wn@@ ', for example, is a pre@@ requis@@ ite for reaching such an agre@@ ement.
Ban@@ ning certain additives is premature until further information on their use and effects is available.
However, banning these substances must not be viewed as the only solution.
Pro@@ hibition of dil@@ ution will reduce the overall contamination load of animal feed.
The banning of new barome@@ ters will not stop pollu@@ tion@@ ; in fact it could become more preval@@ ent as the general public would have no@@ where to take their instrum@@ ents.
Ban@@ ning the NG@@ O meeting from C@@ air@@ o was a most un@@ pleas@@ ant side effect.
The ban on abortion does not reduce the number of such procedures carried out.
From 2005, there will be a ban in Europe on the use and marketing of all types of asbe@@ st@@ os.
The pro@@ hibition of antibiotics will also apply to feed import@@ s.
A ban on phosph@@ ates also has the positive effect that it limits the spreading of harmful cadmium into the environment, since cadmium is released when phosph@@ ates are extr@@ act@@ ed.
The ban on sof@@ ten@@ ers that damage the reproductive system is a milestone in terms of the protection of consumers and particularly of children.
The EU's ban on vaccin@@ ation, which ad@@ he@@ red to the principle that, if even only one animal was vaccin@@ ated, the whole country was declared to be infected with F@@ MD@@ , met with little approval on the part of the public@@ , and even well-@@ informed officials dem@@ anded at the time the use of what are termed mark@@ er vaccines in order to prevent the disease from becoming more widespre@@ ad.
Ban@@ ning human clon@@ ing, for example, does not mean banning work on human cells designed to make skin transpl@@ ants possible.
The ban on N@@ if@@ ur@@ so@@ l may end up being re-@@ examined.
It is therefore not sen@@ sible to ban lead in the glass of light bul@@ b@@ s.
The ban that applied during the en@@ qu@@ iry has been lif@@ ted and the organisation has mean@@ while reported an increase in the applications for egg cell import@@ s.
The ban imposed by the new regulation on more than 1 000 substances used in cosme@@ tics that have been classified as carcinogenic or toxic is also a good thing.
This initial six-@@ month ban has been extended on a rolling basis ever s@@ inc@@ e, despite a categor@@ ical Commission announc@@ ement in 2004 that there was no risk of T@@ SE occur@@ renc@@ e, let alone trans@@ mis@@ sion, from fish@@ meal fed to rum@@ in@@ ants and that the policy of zero tolerance of meat and bone sp@@ ic@@ ules in animal feed should be lif@@ ted.
This applies to button cells, and batter@@ ies for hearing a@@ ids are no longer at risk ei@@ ther.
Because they cannot use S@@ mol@@ t@@ ine, which de@@ als with transferring the fish from fresh water to salt water, they have to use hydro@@ gen per@@ oxide, which is very cost@@ ly and has very serious effects on the life of the fish.
The ban you mention is not on a welfare basis but rather on an ethical basis, which is a different issue.
The ban on chlor@@ inated chickens for consumption must continue to per@@ tain@@ .
A ban would see the end of the tradi@@ tion of barome@@ ter@@ -@@ making and cr@@ af@@ ts@@ man@@ ship, which began over 400 years ago when mercury barome@@ ters were first introduc@@ ed.
A strict ban on advertising remain@@ s: there will be no information on the radi@@ o, television or in magaz@@ in@@ es; instead@@ , patients must actively seek out the information.
The common interest is obvious and clearly defin@@ ed.
The assessment of the main problems and the measures proposed have been somewhat over@@ shado@@ wed by the substantial interest in paragraph 29 of the re@@ solution.
The agreed interest for late pay@@ ment, the reference rate plus 8@@ %, is acceptable, but the EUR 40 minimum recovery charge might become seen as excessive for small and, for example, repeat deliver@@ ies.
The interests of the Commission and the Council are safe, but are they those of the patient@@ s?
The interests of the people concerned should always come before meaning@@ less one-@@ up@@ man@@ ship.
The interests of US and European multin@@ ation@@ als – effectively spon@@ so@@ red and represented by the work of the European Commission – have w@@ on yet again.

Inter@@ mod@@ ality is a key fact@@ or.
Ch@@ arg@@ ing for infrastructure will yiel@@ d all its benefits only when two principles can be fully combin@@ ed: the principle of ‘@@ the pollut@@ er pa@@ ys@@ ’ – and on the roads negative effects arise in terms of the environment, safety and congestion – and the broad@@ er principle of 'the user pa@@ ys@@ '.

The Internet and its various tools are not in themselves op@@ pres@@ sive.
The World W@@ ide We@@ b, the G@@ S@@ M standard for mobile teleph@@ ones, the MP@@ E@@ G standard for digital content and AD@@ S@@ L technology are European inven@@ tions.
The Interne@@ t, Min@@ it@@ el, the post are nothing more than the medi@@ um.
The Interne@@ t, gam@@ es con@@ sol@@ es and computer gam@@ es contain a great deal of viol@@ ent, brut@@ al and er@@ otic content, and can also cause depend@@ ency, insomnia, ag@@ itation and eating disorders.
The Internet itself cannot comm@@ it crim@@ es.
Nevertheless, the Internet only reaches a section of the public that already has an interest@@ .
Although the inter@@ net gives access to information, it unfortun@@ ately also has many dang@@ ers.
The Internet for both rec@@ re@@ ational study or for business use is cat@@ ching on fast in our part of the world.
The Internet could inv@@ al@@ id@@ ate some of these rul@@ es.
The wi@@ rel@@ ess Internet is a requirement for receiving fast broad@@ b@@ and connec@@ tions for all Europe@@ ans.
The wi@@ rel@@ ess Internet will be different from the Internet available only on des@@ k@@ top@@ s.
The wi@@ rel@@ ess Internet will be the obvious hun@@ ting ground of the trou@@ ble@@ mak@@ er.
Oper@@ ational compatibility has been set up as the most important objec@@ tive, and standardisation is part of the solution.
Inter@@ oper@@ ability should and must be made a reality across the entire net@@ work.
Inter@@ oper@@ ability is the next it@@ em on the agend@@ a, and we are currently setting the points for more inter@@ mod@@ ality.
Inter@@ pre@@ tation is always a separate process.
Inter@@ pre@@ ting Article 7 of the Treat@@ y, we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction does not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpre@@ t@@ ations or perform@@ ances themselves as such that are em@@ bodi@@ ed in record@@ ings, but also protection against cop@@ ying, whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or tempor@@ ary, and protection against any other form of production.
The interpretation of the Articles in the Treaty seems to depend on which way the wind is b@@ low@@ ing.
The interpretation must in fact be tel@@ e@@ olog@@ ical, relating to the intended purpos@@ e.
From the interpretation I heard only ‘@@ and@@ ’, ‘@@ 29 and 32@@ ’.
Inter@@ pre@@ tation will also not be done autom@@ aticall@@ y, but intellig@@ ently through in-@@ depth review@@ s, which are dem@@ anding for the Commission but necessary.

The introduction of these systems needs to be comple@@ ted.
Intro@@ duc@@ ing the system will contribute to an improvement in the state of the environment and will counter@@ act climate changes.
The introduction of further tests, different from those concerned with competi@@ tion, in the concentration assessment system would complic@@ ate, conf@@ use and, ultim@@ ately, risk defe@@ ating the primary function of the M@@ erger Regul@@ ation, which is to maintain effective competi@@ tion.

The very head@@ ing of the proposed regulation is in itself fortun@@ ate.
Since the introduction of ER@@ TM@@ S can canc@@ el out this negative aspec@@ t, it is important that the transitional period between the current systems and ER@@ TM@@ S be kept to a minimum in order to restrict additional costs and functional discomfor@@ t as a result of the use of the du@@ al systems.
The introduction of the euro will have as much effect on those countries which remain outside the project as those which go in the first wav@@ e.
The introduction of the euro has only limited effects on transfer costs.
The introduction of the euro should not be at their co@@ st.

The introduction is covered by a special rule and there are no limit@@ s.
If and when this E@@ ID scheme is introduced it should take place on a voluntary rather than a compulsory basis.

The phas@@ ing-@@ in of these changes will be fin@@ alised next year.
The process of introducing these products into the market is stag@@ nat@@ ing.
In@@ vention has to do with research@@ ; inven@@ tion is the process of putting money into knowledg@@ e, of invest@@ ing in knowledg@@ e.

Ireland does not want to be associated with British euro@@ sc@@ eptic@@ ism.
Ireland has 11% of the European se@@ as but less than 4% of the quot@@ as.
Ireland gain@@ s EUR 1.@@ 15 billion from V@@ R@@ T.
Ireland would be in an excell@@ ent position to put such a perspec@@ tive into practice.
Both Ireland and the arbit@@ ration body took the view that controls in 199@@ 1 had improv@@ ed, and that the risk of loss in that year was therefore low@@ er.
It should therefore not be allowed to happen@@ .
The ir@@ radiation of foodstuffs is risk@@ y and un@@ necessary, at least for all foodstuffs with the possible exception of certain her@@ bs and sp@@ ic@@ es.

IS@@ IS has also imp@@ lied severe restrictions in the fisheries of neph@@ rop@@ s, pla@@ ice and sole with - and I quote - '@@ stringent restrictions on the catch and discard rates of c@@ od with effective monitoring of compliance with those restric@@ tion@@ s'.
Is@@ la@@ m has made another step forward.
Is@@ la@@ m is a relig@@ ion based on toler@@ ance, not fan@@ atic@@ ism, a relig@@ ion based on lo@@ ve, not h@@ ate, and it is a cohe@@ rent relig@@ ion based on order@@ , not cha@@ os.

Icel@@ and, and the n@@ ations now st@@ uc@@ k in your ras@@ p@@ ber@@ ry Re@@ ich, will be free at last@@ .
Icel@@ and and I@@ c@@ es@@ ave have been taking great risks for many years.
Sol@@ itary con@@ fin@@ ement must be the exception and not the norm@@ .
I@@ sol@@ ation in the field of energy means some monopol@@ y's normal predomin@@ ance in this market, and for the people concerned that in turn means both uncertain supply and high prices.
I@@ sol@@ ation has led only to des@@ pa@@ ir@@ .
I@@ sol@@ ation has not work@@ ed.
I@@ sol@@ ation is effective in some circumstances, but eng@@ agement is better.
The isol@@ ation of the S@@ ic@@ ili@@ ans is caused by the fact that getting from Pal@@ er@@ m@@ o to M@@ ess@@ ina involves a fiv@@ e-@@ hour train journe@@ y, not the fact that it is 20 minutes by ferry from M@@ ess@@ ina to Reg@@ gi@@ o Cal@@ ab@@ ri@@ a.
The important - and I think the instruc@@ tive - outcome of the case is plain@@ .
The end of this development will therefore again be that high-@@ grade animal protein can be fed to non-@@ veget@@ arian animals if it comes from animals that have been released for human consumption.
The outcome of the vote also reflec@@ ts the suffering and hum@@ iliation of daily life under occu@@ pation, squeez@@ ed between check@@ point@@ s, wall and sett@@ le@@ ments, and at the same time it rings out as a severe criticism of Palestinian politic@@ i@@ ans.
We already know what the outcome of the situation will be.
This is not expected to happen before the end of September at the earli@@ est.
Italy was condemned at the time and there is still no proper plan on the table.
Italy has had the most fe@@ ar@@ ful crisis of competitiv@@ en@@ ess, with its unit labour costs increasing by 40% compared to Germany.
Italy has seen a fall of over 18@@ % in October alone, which is the worst figure in over ten years in the sector.
In the case of Italy, it has already been possible to grant such transitional aid, corresponding to approximately EUR @@ 11 per tonne of sugar be@@ et per production year.
Italy has authorised the laun@@ ch of works on the sou@@ thern access rout@@ e, starting with the first sec@@ tion, For@@ te@@ zz@@ a-@@ P@@ on@@ te Gar@@ den@@ a.
In Italy, 24@@  000 jobs were lost in 2004 and over 66@@  000 in the last three years.
Italy has a lot of experience in dealing with different kin@@ ds of disast@@ ers but they perhaps need help with humanitarian aid for shel@@ ter, food and medicines, and they might also need help with scre@@ en@@ ing, assistance and identi@@ fic@@ ation.
Will Italy therefore continue the e@@ V@@ ote initi@@ ati@@ ve?
It is because of Italy that people are eating and enjo@@ ying it throughout the world@@ !
Italy is known for its gener@@ os@@ ity.
Italy is even more dependent in the energy field, as E@@ ne@@ a and I@@ st@@ at data ir@@ ref@@ ut@@ ably confir@@ m.
Italy is the country where enterpris@@ es suffer most due to late payment by public author@@ ities, with an average period for payment to suppli@@ ers of 180 days as opposed to the European average of 67 days.
Italy is one of the countries that have not only helped to develop the new vaccine against the H@@ 7@@ N@@ 1 virus, but are equip@@ ping themselves best to face the risk of an epide@@ mic@@ : our Ministry has already provided for complete vaccination coverage if necessary, exp@@ anding the veterinary sector and putting in place a labelling system to show the proven@@ ance of each product.
Italy is being pen@@ alis@@ ed, and that is a cause for concern@@ , but what matters most of all is that the reasons for this pen@@ alisation are ill@@ -f@@ oun@@ ded.
Italy is a bad example, one not to be followed, where the f@@ ash@@ ion is still to nation@@ aliz@@ e losses and priv@@ ati@@ ze prof@@ it.
Italy and France report@@ edly plan to stock@@ p@@ ile two million doses of a vaccine e@@ ach, while the UK has decided against this ow@@ ing to the difficulty of design@@ ing an effective anti-@@ viral drug in advance against a mut@@ ative virus.
Italy is included in both groups.

Italy, Spain and Portugal are three Member States which are given a dish@@ on@@ our@@ able mention by the A@@ ud@@ it@@ ors.
Italy must not now experience a situation in which yet more burden@@ s are placed on the people in the form of fin@@ es.
Italy will not succe@@ ed ei@@ ther.
Italy, for instance, does not as yet have a national Ombuds@@ man.
Italy has an energy production capacity of only approximately 30 million tonnes of oil equivalent and has to im@@ port energy from abroad@@ , and its depend@@ ency has gro@@ wn to about 8@@ 5% in 2005 as against 8@@ 3% in 2001 and 8@@ 1% in 1995.

Child@@ hood obesity is a particular concern.
Ch@@ ild obesity is continuing to grow@@ , with 22 million European children now being over@@ weight.
Obes@@ ity is the most common form of malnutrition and ar@@ ises from an excessive storage of fat@@ .
Obes@@ ity is one of the main causes of mortality and chronic disease such as Type 2 diabetes, circul@@ atory disorders, hypertension, heart attacks and certain types of cancer.
Obes@@ ity is a disease, not a problem.
Obes@@ ity is a major problem across Europe and conditions related to obesity and bad nutrition have serious consequences across soci@@ e@@ ties.
Obes@@ ity and maternal diabetes represent an increased risk of maternal and also neon@@ atal mor@@ b@@ idity and mortal@@ ity.
Obes@@ ity and sport for all are closely linked as sport is one of the most effective antid@@ otes or weapons in the fight against obes@@ ity.
Obes@@ ity places a great strain on the bone structure with all the negative consequences that entail@@ s.
Child@@ hood obesity in Europe is growing by 2% per year.
Obes@@ ity amongst children is a growing concern in Europe, and even more so in the UK where almost 25% of the population is obese and 10% of children are over@@ weight.
Obes@@ ity, diabetes, cancers and different forms of circul@@ atory disease are a real threat to the citizen@@ s.

It is an obvious improvement that products must h@@ enc@@ e@@ for@@ th be clearly marked if they contain matter of animal orig@@ in, for reasons of public health, since fur@@ , for example, is a health risk for many people who suffer from allergies.
The obligation to collect equipment, even that which does not form part of a comp@@ any@@ 's product rang@@ e, which in some circumstances involves separ@@ ating products that do and do not contain toxic substances and broken and re@@ us@@ able products, will involve additional costs and a great deal of extra bureaucracy.
The pressure to reduce costs will speed up concentr@@ ation.
The obligation to report side effects and sub@@ mit periodic reports to the authorisation authority ensu@@ res continuous comprehensive assessment of any given medical product.
The im@@ position of dis@@ arm@@ am@@ ent and of the end of the development, production and storage of new nuclear weapons are the basis of the spi@@ rit and letter of the N@@ P@@ T.
The obligation of the EU - the Member States - to offer assistance in the field of administration and of police and judic@@ i@@ ary systems, where this is request@@ ed, was also emphas@@ ised.
The requirement to measure new substances will be included in the directives on air quality.
The requirement to state the reasons for a ref@@ usal l@@ ends weight to such rejec@@ tions and gives balance to the final outcom@@ e.
The prevention of disease is adequately taken care of by the he@@ ating of food waste in the manner prescri@@ be@@ d, which fur@@ ther@@ more facilit@@ ates proper recycling of such rem@@ n@@ ants and thereby acts as a deter@@ rent against even more '@@ rubb@@ ish touris@@ m@@ '.
M@@ ot@@ or@@ cycl@@ ist deaths have fallen by 4@@ 5% across all the age groups since it was made mandatory to wear a hel@@ met last year.
The obligation to take a further rest period after six consecutive driving periods means that long-@@ distance drivers often cannot return to their places of origin and that they therefore have to take their weekly rest@@ s during the journe@@ y.
It is not planned that the public@@ ation of those reasons be made mand@@ atory, but the company whose plans for acqu@@ is@@ ition were thus turned down will be able to demand it.
The obligation to seek out the best de@@ als for cli@@ ents, as well as low trans@@ action costs and investment products suitable for the cli@@ ent f@@ ades into the back@@ groun@@ d.
Com@@ pul@@ sory day@@ time use of head@@ lights is only safe in spar@@ sely popul@@ ated countries with a low sun position, few cyc@@ lists and without the need to make motor@@ bi@@ ke ri@@ ders more vis@@ ible, and there is a problem in this respect.
Re@@ qui@@ re@@ ments for prior authorisation may be imposed only in exceptional cases - if they are specified on the Commission's list or if there is a risk of a mass ex@@ o@@ du@@ s of patients which would under@@ mine the health system. The idea that it might be imposed because so few patients have chosen to seek care ab@@ road is highly unlikely.
For all producers or im@@ por@@ ters to be oblig@@ ed to demonstrate the safety of their product before it can be put on the market is also a positive step to ensure that both consumers and the environment are adequately protec@@ ted.

(FR) Mad@@ am President, Commissioner, the Mediterranean is the region of all divis@@ ion@@ s: ge@@ ographical divis@@ ions, historical divis@@ ions - in Sal@@ am@@ in, A@@ x@@ ion, L@@ ep@@ an@@ to - dem@@ ographic divis@@ ions and even philosoph@@ ical divis@@ ions, between mag@@ ical thinking and logical think@@ ing, in other words the O@@ ri@@ ent and the Oc@@ cid@@ ent, but also the East and West@@ , from the Egyp@@ t of Mos@@ es, then J@@ es@@ us, then Mo@@ ham@@ med, from O@@ mar K@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ am to Ba@@ ud@@ el@@ ai@@ re, from the pl@@ ate@@ a@@ us of Sy@@ ria to the plain@@ s of L@@ angu@@ ed@@ oc@@ .
Commissioner, you are conf@@ using the Product Safety Directive with the To@@ y Safety Direc@@ tiv@@ e!
Mad@@ am Presid@@ ent. Ken@@ ya was not always the sc@@ ene of disorder and brut@@ ality.
Mad@@ am President, Council Regulation No 14@@ 42@@ /@@ 88 of 24 May 198@@ 8 on the grant@@ ing, for the 198@@ 8@@ /@@ 89 to 199@@ 7@@ /9@@ 8 wine years, of permanent abandon@@ ment premi@@ ums in respect of wine-@@ growing areas was last amended by Regulation 15@@ 9@@ 5@@ /9@@ 6 of 30 July 199@@ 6.
You have a fine vo@@ ice, Mrs J@@ en@@ sen@@ , but you caused a few problems for some of the interpre@@ ters who were unable to rise to your level.
Mrs Mc@@ C@@ arth@@ y referred specifically to issues surrounding products and to@@ ys.
Mrs Ma@@ es, a room was made available for you to meet with the people you decided to inv@@ it@@ e.
You are not happ@@ y with the studies that were carried out because the results do not mat@@ ch your particular vision, but there is not much I can do about that.
Mrs M@@ ü@@ l@@ l@@ er, your request has been made correctly in accordance with the R@@ ul@@ es.
(@@ Mrs R@@ oth presented Mr H@@ än@@ s@@ ch with a b@@ ou@@ qu@@ et@@ )
Mrs Sch@@ re@@ y@@ er, you have already acted as if all of this were already in the bag@@ .
Mrs Me@@ hr@@ in, I was very tou@@ ched by your assessment of me as a '@@ la@@ di@@ es' man@@ '.
Mad@@ am, you are supposed to talk on the subject under the cat@@ ch-@@ the-@@ eye procedure.
Mrs W@@ all@@ strö@@ m, you have been working on this for years, you are starting to make head@@ way, and you have to per@@ seve@@ re.
Mrs Bl@@ anc@@ a Rey@@ es, you have the flo@@ or.
Mrs H@@ au@@ w@@ a Ibra@@ him@@ :
The point I wish to make is this, and neither the dogs nor I will mind if you address this as a member of the public or as a member of a govern@@ ment. There are animal protection organisations in Greece, and I know that they catch dogs and that they put down the old and sick dogs that are beyond hel@@ p, and that they seek good hom@@ es for the healthy ones, and that the remain@@ der are ne@@ u@@ tered and then released again.
Mis@@ s Sk@@ ri@@ de, your viol@@ in has the flo@@ or.
My final sugges@@ tion is that for us the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m S@@ LI@@ M - "@@ Sim@@ pl@@ er L@@ eg@@ is@@ lation for the Inter@@ nal Mark@@ et@@ " - should represent "@@ Subst@@ anti@@ ally Less Inter@@ ference by Memb@@ er@@ s@@ ".
My second re@@ mark is that the six month supplementary protection proposed by the Commission and Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ ise G@@ ros@@ set@@ ê@@ te is a good thing, as at present we rely too much on the use of medicines intended for adults as medication directly adapted for children.
The other request I have is for a techn@@ ician to adjust the sound volume here.
When I turned to President Sch@@ m@@ id I was given the following answ@@ er: '@@ You are right, but I cannot ti@@ e the hands of those present in the Hou@@ se@@ .'
Madrid, B@@ es@@ lan@@ , the trag@@ edi@@ es of the European ho@@ stages and last week@@ ’s events in the Netherlands confirm this.
My family has been associated with L@@ loy@@ d@@ ’s for over 200 years in one form or another and I therefore understand the market@@ place and how L@@ loy@@ d@@ ’s func@@ tions.
My wife has not, and the reason is that the hair@@ dres@@ sers p@@ ock@@ et the decrease in tax@@ ation and, therefore, Annex K amounts to a subsid@@ y for hair@@ dres@@ ser@@ s.
My generation and the generation before that did not concern itself very much with the idea of being independent or becoming an entrepre@@ neur@@ .
The whit@@ e@@ wash@@ ing of dangers does not mean that they are non-@@ exist@@ ent, much less that they have been aver@@ ted.
G@@ reat@@ !
Mag@@ n@@ ific@@ ent@@ !
You did f@@ ant@@ as@@ tically well@@ !'
W@@ on@@ der@@ ful@@ !
My great a@@ unt A@@ gn@@ es, at 91 years of age, is one of them.
Ma@@ hat@@ ma G@@ and@@ h@@ i once said that civil@@ isation in a society can be g@@ aug@@ ed by the way it treat@@ s its animals.
It is sc@@ ant comfor@@ t to know that the pollut@@ er will pay in the end.
'@@ H@@ and in hand for peac@@ e' : that was the them@@ e of the Ade@@ p demonstr@@ ation scheduled to take place on 1 September in An@@ k@@ ar@@ a.
Now comes the '@@ but@@ '.
No@@ w, it is the anti-@@ Europe movement which has the heart and s@@ oul@@ , and you can see that they are extremely activ@@ e.
Now it is setting up this method as a method of food conserv@@ ation with, first@@ ly, the possibility of ir@@ radi@@ ating her@@ bs and sp@@ ic@@ es.
Now it is di@@ ther@@ ing over vaccination.
Me@@ an@@ while there is in this re@@ solution, even a Section No@@ . 5 which condem@@ ns outside interven@@ tion!
"@@ Now I am sitting here, sun@@ bath@@ ing in the sun of Italy and I@@ sch@@ ia.
No@@ w, the framework decision stipul@@ ates levels of penal@@ ties ranging from between one and three years for basic off@@ ences to between five and ten years in circumstances that aggrav@@ ate the off@@ ence.
Now the point precisely is that all findings are unanim@@ ous and show a great divide in the way West@@ er@@ ners and Muslim@@ s view each other, with West@@ er@@ ners seen by Muslim@@ s as pat@@ ron@@ ising and dom@@ ine@@ er@@ ing, and Muslim@@ s seen by West@@ er@@ ners as fan@@ atic@@ al and intoler@@ ant.
No@@ w, the Braz@@ ili@@ an authorities must act to ensure that the law is applied and extr@@ ad@@ ite B@@ at@@ ti@@ sti@@ .
Now the cy@@ nic@@ s are rubb@@ ing their hands with g@@ le@@ e at having come up with a no@@ -@@ lose str@@ at@@ ag@@ em@@ .
No@@ w@@ !
The reason given is that more than ECU 11 million cannot be administered.
Now that these values are being consolid@@ ated, al@@ be@@ it not without difficulty and not every@@ where to the same ext@@ ent, it is clearly time for development.
Now that many clim@@ at@@ olog@@ ists are predic@@ ting an increase in temperat@@ ure, with an increased risk of extreme drough@@ t, it is good to take preventive measures to limit the impact of drough@@ t, including deser@@ tific@@ ation.
Having seen that the Commission is concerned about this and having received a very satisfactory response, does the Commission nevertheless intend to implement any measure to lessen the impact of this pre@@ sum@@ ably negative effect before the final date indic@@ ated?
Now you need to get the b@@ all in the ne@@ t.
Now you tell us, in your letter of 12 Jul@@ y, that in the event of any possible changes to the Es@@ sen list being propos@@ ed, you would as@@ certain whether or not these had been identified in Annex@@ es I and II.
No@@ w, here you are repe@@ ating mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ously the words '@@ monitoring defic@@ it@@ s' and '@@ a@@ ust@@ er@@ ity in the S@@ tability P@@ act@@ '.
Main@@ taining the current definition of vod@@ ka and allowing it to be produced from waste material will lower its quality and have a negative impact on its rep@@ ut@@ ation.

Should the label state '@@ home@@ opathic medicin@@ e' without approved therapeutic indic@@ ations?
Time after time development policy is forgotten or is an after@@ thought when the major policies of this European Union are considered.
Many times.
Each time there are dri@@ f@@ ts, however, they are dangerous and they must be st@@ amp@@ ed out.
However, if the danger warnings are increased and consumers are over@@ protec@@ ted, doctors could become dish@@ ear@@ ten@@ ed.
But on the same date the Council is meeting in Berlin and it is impossible for the Commission to be in two places at the same time.
But even at this elev@@ enth hour there is much to do to ensure that the go@@ al@@ posts are up and not mov@@ ed, that the pit@@ ch is level and fit for play and that the b@@ all is hard enough to score goals for Europe right from the k@@ ick@@ -@@ off.
But if one looks at what the development instrument - particularly Article 17@@ 9 - giv@@ es, even with all the constrain@@ ts, the OD@@ A instrument allows the promotion of mus@@ e@@ um@@ s, libr@@ ari@@ es, the ar@@ ts, mus@@ ic in school@@ s, sports training facilities and ven@@ u@@ es - all these count as OD@@ A.
But as time pass@@ es, their presence is becoming more and more emb@@ arr@@ ass@@ ing, and at any time irritation may turn to h@@ ate, with a war of liber@@ ation just around the cor@@ n@@ er.
Then after two or three hours the father just sle@@ p@@ t. But all night the mother was always paying attention to those na@@ ugh@@ ty children.
However, after the surger@@ y, within one week I had fully rec@@ overed.
But what and who will suffer as a result?
En@@ ough about '@@ st@@ up@@ id@@ ' energ@@ y.
Has it imposed a freez@@ e on sett@@ le@@ ments, reduced the check@@ points or lo@@ os@@ ened its str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold on Gaz@@ a?
But has anyone given any thought as to whether this date might not be very far off@@ , and that it might never even happen@@ !
There is no agre@@ ement, however, on how to reduce demand - and without the reduction of dem@@ and, the other measures will be largely in@@ effective.
But not one of these cases was classified in the statistics as being fra@@ u@@ dul@@ ent or as giving rise to suspic@@ ions of "@@ serious neglig@@ enc@@ e@@ " .
Y@@ et, no solution will be good unless it is control@@ lab@@ le.
But a uniform procedure did not appear on the horiz@@ on even then, and has not appeared up to the present time.
But beyond this forest of metal and glas@@ s, this is too little understood.
These days there are dis@@ appointed women who find that they have been poison@@ ed after such treatment.
But at least the Commission has at last w@@ ok@@ en up to this g@@ ig@@ antic and immediate threat@@ .
There is however no need, in terms of the market, for uniform rules on the sale of vitamins and miner@@ als.
But it should also be more responsible about the way it oper@@ ates and controls its affair@@ s, rid@@ ding itself of neglig@@ ence and dem@@ ag@@ og@@ u@@ ery and avoid@@ ing a scapego@@ at cul@@ ture.
Sc@@ rap the mixing of aut@@ oc@@ rac@@ y, however, and gover@@ n with sh@@ re@@ w@@ d@@ ness and corpor@@ ati@@ sm@@ !
But before taking this ste@@ p, a proper assessment must be made of these measures in the light of experience.
However, before taking any legislative measures, we must identify the reasons why the food chain has been down@@ grad@@ ed and adul@@ ter@@ ated.
But B@@ ell@@ ac@@ ru@@ z has achieved a s@@ ad no@@ tor@@ i@@ ety because the h@@ aci@@ end@@ a is own@@ ed by the Mar@@ ul@@ anda famil@@ y.
Natur@@ ally, however, the discipl@@ inary action has to be proposed on the same day or the following day.
But whenever new rules are cre@@ ated, of course, there is always the possibility that they will not be observed.
But@@ ...
But it is not the only case, Sar@@ im@@ u Mo@@ ha@@ med, Saf@@ i@@ ya H@@ us@@ s@@ ain@@ i, B@@ ari@@ ya Ibra@@ him@@ a and A@@ dam@@ a Y@@ un@@ us@@ a have also been sentenced to prison following a series of international campaign@@ s to prevent these ston@@ ings.
However, this does not mean that there should not be controls.
This is not an immediate process.
However, the pre-@@ requis@@ ite for such an approach would be the availability in restaur@@ ants and shops of machines where the code could be ent@@ ered.
However, that source must go together with reliable and responsible clinical and laboratory support.
But you forget how easily the mu@@ d thrown at a few of you may stick to all of you.
But it was a bab@@ y's step forwar@@ d, a tor@@ tu@@ ous step forwar@@ d: hardly an improvement on what had been agreed in Mon@@ tre@@ al.
They were effective in terms of growth and an increase in employ@@ ment, though@@ .
But it did happen and after only 20 years in the life of the same gener@@ ation.
However, this was merely cosme@@ tic.
This will last a few more months and then it will be over and done with.
However, this must not result in the application forms and the explan@@ ations of how the funding can be obtained being so leng@@ thy and in@@ comprehen@@ sible that you need a PhD to understand them.
It should not, however, lead to day@@ light rob@@ ber@@ y.
But that is not all that is needed.
However, this is little more than a drop in the oc@@ e@@ an.
However, this is not unique to patent@@ s: it applies to design@@ s and tra@@ de@@ marks as well.
It goes further than this though@@ . This is not just about the product.
This could me@@ an, however, that a situation in which one produced a human embryo or, taking the interpretation a stage fur@@ ther, a baby without a brain, cloned it and then used if not for reproduction but as a supply of sp@@ are parts for organ@@ s, this would clearly not be excluded.
The environment is altogether too important to be left to the L@@ ef@@ t.
However, this mechanism is used on an ad hoc basis and only in certain cases.
But even then it was high dram@@ a!
It cannot be and it must not be.
However, this appears to be a hol@@ low ph@@ ras@@ e.
However, these are just the tip of the ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ .
Yet this is just a drop in the oc@@ e@@ an.
However, this is only one measure and inadequate at that@@ : more are needed.
However, this is sad@@ ly not the case on the border between Th@@ ail@@ and and Cam@@ bodi@@ a, whose arm@@ ies have cl@@ as@@ hed several times in the past couple of weeks over a disput@@ ed, tin@@ y, part of their border near to an anc@@ ient tem@@ ple@@ .
Th@@ at, however, is not a solution to V@@ W@@ 's problems or those of other car factor@@ ies.
However, this is not fraud@@ , but waste@@ ful@@ ness.
C@@ r@@ imin@@ alising the people and organisations fighting against For@@ tre@@ ss Europe is not, however, an effective tac@@ tic against the under@@ ground networks and smuggl@@ ers.
No such th@@ ing!
But just because the grand@@ mother in a family has diabetes it does not mean that all the children have to go without sug@@ ar@@ : a treatment aimed at cur@@ ing the illness of one cannot be applied to every@@ body.
This is not possible, however, because the committee has not yet started to oper@@ ate.
But they are the tip of an ic@@ e@@ berg that needs to be ex@@ pos@@ ed.
But this on-@@ board system has to be capable of being servic@@ ed not only by f@@ ran@@ ch@@ ised work@@ shops but also by small gar@@ ages, autom@@ ob@@ ile club@@ s and technical inspection facil@@ ities.
But that is a de@@ tail for another day.
However, this potential remains un@@ t@@ app@@ ed.
But this product is actually a drug@@ !
What I condem@@ n the most is that girls as young as 14 are affected.
What you are proposing is not forwar@@ d-@@ look@@ ing.
However, what may be even more serious is the use of cl@@ ust@@ er mun@@ i@@ tions.
T@@ ech@@ no@@ cr@@ ac@@ y, however, is not about having technical knowledg@@ e; it is about never putting any feeling into it.
However, what does seem to be correct is the information that unemployment may rise - according to the studies - by between 2.@@ 2 % and 3.@@ 7 %.
This report would be sad@@ ly medi@@ oc@@ re, however, if the sc@@ at@@ ter@@ gun approach that has produced all these rec@@ it@@ als had not also produced the request to lif@@ t the ban introduced in 10@@ 45 on women entering M@@ ount Ath@@ os, the Greek orth@@ od@@ ox sanc@@ tu@@ ary for mon@@ ks.
The main focus of this Regul@@ ation, however, is the simpli@@ fication of vari@@ ation@@ s; that is, of the partial extension or variation of the pharmaceutical form of a medicinal product.
This European network can only be achieved, however, by increasing the number of inter@@ connec@@ tions.
It also h@@ ides the fact that during the same period income levels have been maintained largely by a fall of 15.@@ 7% in the number of farms within the European Union.
The risk of ethnic conflic@@ t, however, must not be a reason to op@@ pose democ@@ rati@@ z@@ ation.
'@@ Of cour@@ se@@ ,@@ ' I told them.
However, some of the package is un@@ satisfactory and it is not as strong as it should be.
But there are some that present enormous dang@@ ers, particularly those that are associated with traditional diseases, for example, the micro-@@ organis@@ ms associated with things like bub@@ onic pl@@ agu@@ e.
These profits were as high as they were because they included a risk pre@@ mium to cover the event@@ u@@ ality of cred@@ itors de@@ faul@@ ting.
The recent happen@@ ings are far from encourag@@ ing.
To be prec@@ ise, it was not the USA alone that initiated the war@@ : a whole str@@ ing of alli@@ es, some of whom acted open@@ ly, but others secret@@ ly, also joined together in the '@@ co@@ al@@ ition of the willing@@ ', or perhaps we should say '@@ co@@ al@@ ition of the compli@@ ant@@ '.
These final arrang@@ ements, however, appear to be the result of political reaction in the heat of the moment to the ship@@ wrec@@ k of the Pre@@ stig@@ e.
However, it is women, and not men, who are discrimin@@ ated against in this way.
This wh@@ ole@@ hear@@ ted support must not, however, be in@@ discrimin@@ ate or un@@ condition@@ al.
But these are not related process@@ es; it is just a co@@ incid@@ ence.
But they are also very bl@@ un@@ t.
But it is in the high-@@ land@@ scap@@ e areas, the mountain@@ ous areas, the h@@ illy areas in my own area that I represent - Ex@@ mo@@ or and D@@ art@@ mo@@ or and B@@ od@@ min Mo@@ or - that the green land@@ scap@@ e is kept by sheep farm@@ ing.
But these tests only show positive after a certain period of time in the contaminated don@@ or, a period during which antibodies are produced yet during which the antibodies are still not sufficient to be detected by the tests.
A@@ ren@@ ' t there any fish@@ ?'
It is this Europe, however, so full of challenges and difficul@@ ties, whose recent history has accelerated to the speed of light and which has seen all its bal@@ ances change in a little over half a doz@@ en years, that has separated the strong from the weak and the win@@ ners from the tim@@ id and those resign@@ ed to their f@@ ate.
But there is a rather important point being missed he@@ re: you have been the bos@@ s; you have been the govern@@ or for the last five years.
Europe is certainly not responsible for this failure, however, if stopping the dri@@ ft of ultr@@ al@@ iber@@ alism can indeed be called a failure.
And that was an an@@ om@@ aly@@ ; it was ou@@ tr@@ age@@ ous.
This leg@@ ac@@ y, however, cannot be ref@@ used.
However, the work has not yet fin@@ ished.
The approach is not appropriate, however, in the very common cases where fin@@ ance is being sought just on one occas@@ ion or at intervals greater than one year.
However, this decision was not put to the vote because it was not necessary.
But that is an artificial distinc@@ tion, since it is based on the intention behind the clon@@ ing, whereas the act itself is identical in both cas@@ es: therapeutic cloning also essentially involves the reproduction of embryos by clon@@ ing.
There also need@@ s, however, to be legislation with a view to more vulnerable groups such as children, born and as yet un@@ bor@@ n.
Then this house needs a care@@ tak@@ er.
But is protection enough on its own@@ ?
The Commission and some Members shared this reaction, however, by restric@@ ting the definition of generic products, tigh@@ tening the conditions for granting authorisations and extending the periods for authorisation by using various tr@@ ick@@ s: swit@@ ch, new indications etc.
However, the solution must be designed in such a way that the whole thing makes sense.
That did not work because of cross-@@ contamin@@ ation.
That does me@@ an, however, that the disease must be detected very ear@@ ly, since that leads to a considerable reduction in the number of deaths from it.
However, this urgent humanitarian resolution can be linked to the elec@@ tions and to the political gain@@ s that may be had in driving populations out of the town@@ ships in which they are st@@ ay@@ ing.
But since this area is an area of law@@ lessness, where the arbitr@@ ary will of those who are armed rul@@ es, they arrest@@ , they imp@@ ris@@ on, they even exec@@ ut@@ e, without any complain@@ t from any@@ one.
Not all is ros@@ y, however, in Tim@@ or as you all kno@@ w.
However, whenever the voice of the people was igno@@ red, ten@@ sions and rever@@ s@@ als swe@@ pt away both the@@ ories and theore@@ tic@@ i@@ ans.
However, how much will this cost and when will it arri@@ ve, if indeed it do@@ es?
Now like at the end of Ge@@ orge Or@@ well@@ 's '@@ Animal F@@ arm@@ ' the pigs have become men and the men pig@@ s.
As this right is pure f@@ ab@@ ric@@ ation, it is quickly added that the list is '@@ indic@@ ati@@ ve@@ '.
But as these people change their names each time, it is difficult to detect them other than by finger@@ pr@@ int@@ ing.
As usu@@ al, however, this type of report is full of rather v@@ agu@@ e, bl@@ ank@@ et proposals that are actually un@@ acceptable, and is ro@@ o@@ ted in strong lef@@ ti@@ st, ecological and pro-@@ immigr@@ ation con@@ not@@ ations.
However, as it is produced industri@@ ally, these producers must have their place in EU administration.
Dem@@ on@@ str@@ ably better support was given when other countries joined - Spain being one of them.
Ho@@ w, though, can a Member State be supplied via another Member State if the inter@@ connec@@ tions are weak or non-@@ exist@@ ent?
But how else is this fight best f@@ ough@@ t, if not through democrac@@ y?
Because how was that result ob@@ tain@@ ed?
We cannot but observe also - at a time when the thought police are every@@ where hun@@ ting down rather than ref@@ uting book@@ s, by the Mar@@ x@@ ist prof@@ essor Gar@@ aud@@ y, for example - that there are thousands of tonnes of literature sold in newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and in book@@ shop@@ s, magaz@@ ines, bo@@ oks and newspap@@ ers which ex@@ ul@@ t, adv@@ oc@@ ate and describe all forms of sexual perversion and sa@@ dis@@ m, and inc@@ ite people to them.
But how do you get innov@@ ation?
But how will it arri@@ ve, and when, and in what form@@ ?
However, for standard@@ s, it is no different than for other scientific work. You cannot expect them to be available in a week or in one, or indeed sever@@ al, months.
But@@ , as e@@ ver, it is all hot air and naïve ide@@ alism.
But@@ , as al@@ ways, there is tr@@ uth on the banks of the J@@ ord@@ an, mistak@@ es on the banks of the Se@@ ine.
As the work of human hand@@ s, however, it is not perfect or pol@@ ished.
A Con@@ stitution and political will alone, however, are not enough to make reality the project of the lik@@ es of Kon@@ ra@@ d Aden@@ au@@ er, Rob@@ ert Sch@@ um@@ an, Alc@@ ide De G@@ as@@ peri@@ , Je@@ an Mon@@ ne@@ t, Ga@@ etan@@ o Mart@@ ino and Al@@ ti@@ er@@ o Sp@@ in@@ el@@ li@@ .
But there is also the danger of a cas@@ us b@@ ell@@ i in wa@@ it@@ ing, the day when France too is tou@@ ched by d@@ rou@@ ght and turn@@ s off the tap to Spain.
In that case, however, it is also clear who will be responsible if the error rate increases next year.
In these cases, however, special be@@ d@@ ded units with access to water have been designed so that the animals can be transported in relative comfor@@ t.
However, in the specific case of Spain, the 199@@ 2-@@ 9@@ 3, 199@@ 3-@@ 94 and 199@@ 4-@@ 95 seas@@ ons were all catastroph@@ ic because of drough@@ t.

What information is it that has to be protec@@ ted?
What resul@@ ts?
But who are they po@@ king fu@@ n at@@ ?@@ !
However, unfortunate events such as those which took place on 22 Jun@@ e, caused by a small number of people, must not become the general ru@@ le.
But as soon as we are specific, then the harmon@@ y rapidly disappears.
There are ethical problems in not using the technology as well.
However, two proposals were particularly shock@@ ing.
From whose point of view would such a decision be im@@ parti@@ al?
But por@@ k was sol@@ d, was processed and has been e@@ aten by humans and of course MP@@ A in humans can cause inf@@ er@@ ti@@ lit@@ y.
Nevertheless, it adopted a paragraph 34@@ , which '@@ reg@@ re@@ ts government actions to block or delay authorisation of GM products for reasons not based on objective scientific opin@@ ion@@ ' , which may amount to the same thing, depending on what one understand@@ s by the phrase '@@ objective scientific opin@@ ion@@ ' .
But at the same time, it provides for a shor@@ t, further period of adjust@@ ment.
But it then goes on to posit the European Union as an alternative or antidote to such tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian@@ ism.
However, the coordination being adv@@ oc@@ ated will be volun@@ tar@@ y.
However, it should be used more specific@@ ally, so that the policy can be laid down appropri@@ ately and implemented.
However, its population includes many non-@@ Chinese ethnic groups, the largest of which is the U@@ igh@@ ur@@ s.

It may also lead to what are known as complic@@ ations, and even to certain kin@@ ds of permanent impairment of the body.

It can be taken at any time, however, and no further meeting is required for the purpos@@ e.
But it is also due to the fact that we often use antibiotics rout@@ in@@ ely in order to prevent diseases or to cure "@@ minor@@ ' diseases, by mixing antibiotics in feeding@@ stuff@@ s and giving them to animals on a daily basis.
However, it has dimin@@ ish@@ ed; it has gradually eb@@ bed away.

These causes must not, however, serve to mask the influence of these insec@@ tic@@ ides.
However, they are only acceptable if there is evidence of immediate danger and proof that there is a greater risk than without a pre-@@ emp@@ tive war@@ .
But it is also important in the form@@ ing of attit@@ ud@@ es.
But in the interim this should not be used as a reason for taking our foot off the accel@@ er@@ ator on this important issue.
However, under no circumstances should this constitute grounds for a marketing authorisation to be ref@@ used.
I can@@ not, however, under any circumstances accept reven@@ ge polici@@ es, ex@@ communic@@ ations and wit@@ ch hun@@ ts.
On the issue of a possible European t@@ elec@@ ommunic@@ ations regulation ag@@ ency, I would remind you that a study carried out for the Commission in October 1999 concluded that there was no immediate need for such a body. At the same time the Council concluded that regulation should be applied at the clos@@ est possible level to that at which the activities to be regulated are carried out.
However, in a democrac@@ y, control is exercised by Parliament in the Chamb@@ er, and not by sur@@ f@@ ers on the We@@ b.
It is up to you.
But at the end of the process the volunteers will have gained a rich experience.
Nevertheless, at the same time, less desirable consequences have appe@@ are@@ d, such as the increase in the number of times when some passeng@@ ers, with a valid tic@@ k@@ et, cannot board because more tic@@ kets have been sold than the number of seats available.
At the same time, and in the same breath, others - sometimes exactly the same people - are sa@@ ying, '@@ You cannot let the markets dict@@ ate how you act@@ '.

Unfortunately, according to an expert from the Technical Committee on products for small children and to@@ y safety of the Polish Committee for Stand@@ ardis@@ ation, rapid exchange of information between Member States and the European Commission on products which pose a haz@@ ard, and steps taken in particular countries to prevent or restrict their coming onto the market, is still not functioning satisfactor@@ ily.

Even if it is the case that on average young men have more car accidents than young women, or that on average women live longer than men, this is not true of all individu@@ als, and these individuals are disadvant@@ aged accordingly.

Even if the same potential and the same financial resources as are envisaged in this area were to be invest@@ ed in ther@@ mal insul@@ ation for example, energy requirements could be reduced by three times as mu@@ ch.
Even if the way Strasbourg beha@@ ved may be considered discour@@ te@@ ous, there was no illeg@@ ality or mis@@ appropri@@ ation.
Although there are countries in which the alcohol limit for driving is zero and others where it is 80 mg per 100 ml of blood, these differences should be remov@@ ed, if we want to have a un@@ ified Europe.
Even if we include the new countries in the equ@@ ation, the staff@@ -to-@@ population ratio falls from 0.@@ 8 officials per 10@@  000 inhabitants to 0.@@ 7 per 10@@  @@ 000.
Even if not all of us are certain that human life is present at concep@@ tion and during the first stages of pregnancy, there is su@@ rely no one who would arg@@ ue ration@@ ally that we can be 100@@ % certain that human life is not present during those first days, weeks and months of pregnancy.
Even if we meet our 2@@ o target that means a 25% reduction in water avail@@ abil@@ ity@@ ; it means a 10% decline in cro@@ p yiel@@ d@@ s; it means 50 million more people subject to mal@@ ari@@ a; it means 10 million more subject to coast@@ al flood@@ ing; it means dram@@ atic increases in respir@@ atory, cardi@@ ovascul@@ ar, vec@@ tor@@ -@@ borne diseases, skin cancer and ey@@ es@@ ight problems.

Even a minor reduction in the rate of increase of the budget may be quite damaging to some of the small institu@@ tions, especially those that are at the development stage.
Even the sligh@@ test 1 mm reduction through ev@@ ap@@ oration in an area the size of Slovakia corresponds on a sun@@ ny day to a release of metabolic heat equivalent to the year@@ ly output of all the power stations in Slovak@@ ia.

Nonetheless, at peak access times a delayed response could not be completely avoided because of the extremely high number of simultaneous request@@ s.
This does not, however, relieve the European Union of its task of monitoring all projects well, down to the t@@ ini@@ est, and to evaluate them at regular interval@@ s.
But this happens on a regular basis.
But that does not mean that, every time a woman is elec@@ ted, or every time a government is composed of as many women as men, it should in itself be a reason to feel satis@@ fied.
For the consum@@ er, however, this means that quality has its price and that food, including meat, should not be used, as it has been to date, as a l@@ ure in super@@ market@@ s.
However, this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially mas@@ cul@@ ine because it has tradi@@ tionally been reserv@@ ed for men.

However, there are some points on which the Council@@ 's position is im@@ mov@@ able@@ ; for example, it does not accept any changes to the provisions regarding daily and year@@ ly limit values.
However, banning young people from gam@@ bling will not get us any@@ where. One study has shown that one in ten stud@@ ents in Ham@@ burg between the ages of 14 and 18 il@@ legally plays for money on the Interne@@ t, whether in the form of on@@ line po@@ ker or sports bet@@ ting.
However, I cannot support measures that may lead to the wid@@ er use of sn@@ us, because its use has its own health@@ -related problems, including oral cancer.
However, I believe that it is only possible to measure the reduction in emissions during the life cycle of the fuel if there are corresponding standard values in place.

The Commission will, however, monitor the implementation of the directive to ensu@@ re, in particular, that derog@@ ations concerning objective measures and cas@@ ual work are strictly limited to those no@@ tions.

Nevertheless, the list of sources of pressure and op@@ pression against journal@@ ists is a long one.

However, increasing investment activity - and in particular the switch to more sustainable energy production - definit@@ ely plays a part too.
Nevertheless, the authorisation to pub@@ lish package leaflet summ@@ aries means that there will be items that must be highlighted and others, such as adverse reactions, which may well be regularly excluded from the summ@@ ari@@ es, as they do not '@@ sell@@ ' well.

But@@ , even with all that co@@ ver, it can still find its way to the bottom of the p@@ ile and the leaflet that comes in the door is not put on displa@@ y.
However, even if people are not excluded from work but cannot get to work because they cannot get the access they need, that leads to ex@@ clusion as well.
However, we also need to recognise that this is not always possible, especially in the case of rare diseases, where treatment may not be available in the patient's Member State of aff@@ ili@@ ation.
We should at least however seek to ensure that no one is allowed to fall below a certain minimum and that the reasons for any differenti@@ als are clear@@ .
Nevertheless, there are other aspects which we would like to under@@ line. Firstly, the maximum quantity to be donated should be the sa@@ me, independent of weight, since volume of blood and body mass are two different th@@ ings, and there is no direct relation between the two quanti@@ ties.

However, over the long term, it is clear that humanitarian agencies cannot and must not continue to make up for the weakness@@ es of the Ha@@ iti@@ an State or to take its place, and that urgent action must finally be taken to ensure long-term development, in particular, as regards access to healthcare and drinking water and urban renew@@ al.

This will l@@ end our opinion greater top@@ ic@@ ality and greater weight.
Our cap@@ tain has a huge advantage over poor Mr S@@ mith@@ . The ic@@ e@@ berg is star@@ ing him in the face, but he still has time to avoid it.
In Europe our capital lies in the best trained young people of all class@@ es, in other words irrespective of their family origin@@ s.
Our committee has requested that the authorisation procedures test the hormonal effects not only of the pesticides themselves but also of their waste products and addi@@ tives, as it is precisely additives such as sof@@ ten@@ ers and emul@@ si@@ fi@@ ers which are known in other areas of the chemical industry for their harmful effects on hormone systems.
Our competitiv@@ eness must not be based on low w@@ ages or factors of scale, but on the growth of innov@@ ation, science and development, as well as on skills development, or, to use the j@@ arg@@ on, the development of what is termed ‘@@ human capit@@ al@@ ’.
So our confidence in the group of advis@@ ers has to some extent been weak@@ en@@ ed.
Our contin@@ ent has thus become a place not of di@@ vision, but of similar@@ ities and recon@@ c@@ ili@@ ations.
The cooperation in the preparation of the final version of the document has been ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary.

Our Europe was with Th@@ omas@@  @@ Mann@@ , with Al@@ ber@@ t@@  @@ E@@ in@@ ste@@ in, perhaps with Mar@@ len@@ e@@  @@ Di@@ e@@ tric@@ h@@ ; it was with D@@ on Lu@@ ig@@ i St@@ ur@@ z@@ o, with Ga@@ etan@@ o@@  @@ Sal@@ v@@ em@@ ini@@ , with En@@ ric@@ o@@  @@ Fer@@ m@@ i.
The evaluation of this liber@@ alisation was very medi@@ oc@@ re.
Our joint overall assessment is tw@@ o@@ fold and I will out@@ line it bri@@ e@@ fl@@ y.

Our group believ@@ es that the co@@ ins, which will have one national and one common face, can be more easily recogn@@ ized by those who use them by features such as their weight, sha@@ pe@@ , colour and diame@@ ter.
Since our group is in favour of setting dat@@ es, both for the end of marketing and for the end of experim@@ ent@@ ation, we consider it appropriate to extend the dead@@ lines proposed by the rapporteur in such a way that the pro@@ hibition of marketing will take place within ten years of the approval of the revision and the pro@@ hibition of experim@@ entation will be delayed by two years, in the event that alternative available methods are not found for cases in which ingredi@@ ents, or mix@@ tures of ingredi@@ ents, may cause serious der@@ mat@@ ological or ocular damage
Our group does not dis@@ agree with the observation that women must have control over their sexual and reproductive righ@@ ts.

It is a country in which our intervention needs to be more for@@ ce@@ ful@@ , more st@@ able@@ ; we shall often need to have a more active role than in any other case.
Our food safety EU reference laboratory in Rome developed in record time a method which reduces the time needed to detect the E coli bacter@@ ium in food from about six days to 48 hours.

We have an out@@ dated model which needs moder@@ n@@ is@@ ing.
We have become as many as four times ric@@ her over the last 40 years.
Our proposal aim@@ s, therefore, to provide information that is sufficiently complete whilst guar@@ ding against the om@@ is@@ sion of any ingredients which might cause allergies or intoler@@ ances.
We want these recommendations to be taken into account at the W@@ T@@ O@@ 's interim review in April 2001.
Our ultim@@ ate aim has to be the reduction of these unwanted by-@@ catches and the virtu@@ al elimination of discar@@ ds through a discard ban@@ , with incen@@ tives in place to ensure that all unwanted by-@@ catch must be lan@@ ded.
It was therefore important to have particip@@ ated in the first two stag@@ es.
Our past has seen not only gl@@ ories but also war@@ s and blood@@ sh@@ ed.

Our greatest concern in the EP@@ P is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is resto@@ red.
Our GDP per capit@@ a has increased from 64 % of the EU average in 198@@ 3 to 8@@ 7 % last year.
Our starting point is the re@@ alisation that the results achieved to date are inadequate.
Our policy on these issues needs to be a little w@@ is@@ er, a little more moderate and, in all events, better explain@@ ed.
We are all concerned that young people should not drin@@ k, but wine has to be produc@@ ed@@ ...
We are all concerned that young people should not eat too much fat, or too much sugar, because all these things can affect our health, but there are pig@@ meat producers and sugar produc@@ er@@ s@@ ...

Our problem is no longer one of transmit@@ ters or rece@@ iver@@ s, compu@@ ters or hard@@ wa@@ re.
Our proposal for more effective monitoring of the actual effects of approved medicines, for example, pre@@ suppos@@ es this type of active involvement on the part of patients.
Our proposal would still be on a shel@@ f ga@@ ther@@ ing dust if it had not been for the events in New Yor@@ k five days later.
What we are as@@ king about today are the conditions under which the present super@@ ann@@ uated form of combined transport can be sustained for long enough to develop into that model of the future, without it gr@@ in@@ ding to a hal@@ t and simply being over@@ run by the road@@ -@@ transport jug@@ ger@@ na@@ ut@@ .

In Rules 16@@ 2 and 16@@ 3, provision has been made not only for chang@@ es, but also for ways of applying and interpre@@ ting the Rules should anyone try to reduce the proposals to absur@@ d@@ ity, for example by ev@@ oking the famous case of the cup of coffe@@ e that it would no longer possible to offer one's vis@@ it@@ ors.
Our answer must not be in the same P@@ av@@ lo@@ vi@@ an vein.
Our healthcare net@@ work, from prevention to after@@ care, is bank@@ rup@@ ting the public co@@ ff@@ ers.
Our response was pa@@ the@@ tic.
Our role should be to monitor closely these and other developments in the market and be ready to respond if and when necessary.
Our role as legis@@ lat@@ ors is to legisl@@ ate.
Our role is clearly defined in the tre@@ ati@@ es in the event of agreement - and in the event of dis@@ agre@@ ement, which was not very lik@@ ely, but it has happened for the first time in 26 years.
There could also be benefits for our health, in the form of medicinal products or cosme@@ tics.
Our sole concern should be doing what is best for patients, which is what the Commission is propos@@ ing.

There are people in our Union who are not reli@@ gi@@ ous.
The way in which we use the Internet is also rapidly being trans@@ formed from the passive acqu@@ is@@ ition of information to an inter@@ active approach.

We should remember that car@@ age@@ en can be used in baby food and create problems in bab@@ i@@ es' diges@@ tive systems.
We have to re@@ alise that C@@ F@@ R is work in progress and will take some years to complet@@ e.
The first flights to operate from Mal@@ pens@@ a, for example, began as early as 19@@ 10.
We must not forget that cosme@@ tic products are the most frequently counterfe@@ ited products and this only increases the likelihood of harmful materials being present.
We must not forget that who@@ ever sell@@ s or bu@@ ys this material is ab@@ using a child - a child who is not just a pic@@ ture, but a real person who exists and has been viol@@ ated.

We recognise that the production of generic drugs could greatly improve access to care and treatment for HIV/@@ A@@ ids.
It probably is late - too l@@ ate, I agree - but just think of the cas@@ e-@@ f@@ ile from Osi@@ ek to V@@ uk@@ ov@@ ar, S@@ re@@ b@@ ren@@ ica to Sar@@ aj@@ ev@@ o, Bi@@ ha@@ c to T@@ uz@@ la and so many other sha@@ me@@ ful crim@@ es, to which we failed to respon@@ d.

We all appreci@@ ate the ability to purch@@ ase certain medicines over the coun@@ ter, without the need to go to the doctor.
We have lear@@ n@@ ed, for instance, that one Member State allows the inclusion of untreated specifi@@ ed-@@ risk materials in feed mix@@ es, that others are not manag@@ ing to remove the spinal column at the abat@@ to@@ ir and that some of the approved tests have turned out to be rather in@@ effective in the field.
We learn that the Pre@@ fec@@ t of the A@@ us@@ ch@@ wit@@ z region has apparently author@@ ized a demonstr@@ ation by the F@@ ar R@@ igh@@ t, under N@@ az@@ i bann@@ ers, and really it is hard to say which is worse - the viol@@ ent den@@ ial or the commercial tri@@ vi@@ aliz@@ ation.
We are ne@@ aring the end of the year and it is normal to have meals at which you drink a little over the od@@ ds or at least more than usual.

In 2001 there was an increase of just over 10% in imports of these products to the European market, whereas in 2002 there was a slight fall in numb@@ ers.
We had group meet@@ ing@@ s; I was watching the scre@@ en and you jum@@ ped from Question 41 to 49@@ .
We had the Y@@ ear of Fol@@ k C@@ ul@@ ture, the Mon@@ th of the Bo@@ ok@@ , the Mon@@ th of the Cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lo@@ v@@ ak@@ -@@ Soviet Fri@@ end@@ ship, the C@@ os@@ mo@@ s We@@ e@@ k, the Min@@ ers' D@@ a@@ y.
We always had a very clear philos@@ ophy@@ : that you have to have the product right before you can market it well@@ : you need bo@@ th.

Over@@ night, we have had the econom@@ ically cal@@ am@@ it@@ ous, but un@@ surpris@@ ing, news that another country has bit@@ ten the dust and that Portugal is going to have to be b@@ ail@@ ed out.
There has been a gradual progression fro@@ m, first@@ ly, the sor@@ ts of medicinal products that are suscepti@@ ble to falsi@@ fication to later include other medicines in secure packaging.
We also saw an increase in the trend for falsi@@ fying even life-@@ saving medicines, including medicines to treat cancer and heart disease, psychiatric disorders and infections.
We need vitamin and mineral supplements, sometimes in high doses, to be able to balance the functions of the body.
We desper@@ ately need more resources for drugs and vaccin@@ es, but must also ensure their adequate distribution to people, so that drugs do not sit in storage deterior@@ ating.
We need further research, and a continuous flow of new medicines and vaccines capable of responding to new complications and resistant strain@@ s of various pathogen@@ s.
The scientific evidence that GM is safe must be rob@@ ust, and the public must have full confidence that the appropriate authorities have taken all necessary safety precautions and carried out rigorous testing.
We need cleare@@ r labels to indicate where animal products are used to make a gar@@ ment, in particular, in the case of fur and fur trim@@ .
We need foreign invest@@ ors in places such as Tel@@ for@@ d, nor@@ th Sh@@ rop@@ shire, H@@ ere@@ for@@ d, Ros@@ s-@@ on-@@ Wy@@ e and Wy@@ re Fo@@ rest@@ .
We need a framework directive on musculoskeletal disorders to address a problem such as lower back pain - repe@@ ti@@ tive strain injuri@@ es, effectively - and lower back disorders.
We need these re@@ vel@@ ations to be placed under an inten@@ se spot@@ light.
We have calculated the CO2 imp@@ act@@ : 1@@ 25 g in 20@@ 15 is worse than 130 g in 20@@ 12.
We have what I call 'the half-@@ an-@@ aspir@@ in syndrome@@ '@@ : you give a child half the dose you would give an adul@@ t, because you think it ought to have less than the full dose.

We have already ga@@ thered experience in the area of clinical tests for develop@@ mental diseases.
We already have enough problems with the increasing number of people developing resistance to antibiotics.

We have two small pip@@ el@@ in@@ es: the IT@@ G@@ I and the T@@ AP@@ .
We have therefore stipul@@ ated that measurement must start with a cold motor@@ cycle and must also cover higher speed rang@@ es, and also include an open-@@ road sec@@ tion, because in practice motor@@ cycles are of course s@@ carc@@ ely driven at a maximum speed of 50 k@@ m.
We reduced the suggested proportion of star@@ ch in baby foods from 50@@ g per kg to 5@@ g per kg.
We should call for urgent studies into the effect of micro@@ clim@@ ates and the effect of veget@@ ation adj@@ ac@@ ent to water reserv@@ es.
There is time to do it. It must be done.
We were also careful not to apply this temporary measure to a wide range of products but to apply it only to those that can be controlled and evaluated.
We were also able to del@@ et@@ e the part on '@@ Information Sec@@ ur@@ ity@@ ' of EU@@ 007 because among the possible destin@@ ations were some non-@@ democratic countries.
We also mentioned the special case of port areas where, due to the mixing of bodies of water caused by the dre@@ dg@@ ing of ri@@ vers and est@@ u@@ ari@@ es, the quality standards and analysis methods appear un@@ suit@@ able.
Sel@@ f-@@ harm is also emphas@@ ised because of its increasing incid@@ ence.

We also have a high incidence of other conditions such as diabetes where advances in insulin production, as a direct result of biotechnolog@@ ical research, have been of enormous benef@@ it.
We have worked out the measures to be taken in the presence of ice.
In Ireland we have a very high incidence of in@@ her@@ ited diseases such as c@@ ys@@ tic fibrosis and sp@@ ina b@@ if@@ id@@ a.

We then spent approximately one hour squ@@ ab@@ bling with the Council as to whether that dead@@ line should be three weeks or 20 working days.
Then we saw the aw@@ ful re@@ pris@@ als in which Z@@ ak@@ i@@ bi@@ an, a town of 20 000 people, was destroyed and over 200 people killed.
We have heard that there is not enough water and that it is therefore impossible for people to w@@ ash and to protect themselves against infection.
We have made a ru@@ le, and implemented it inter@@ nation@@ ally, to the effect that the trial period is added on to the term of the pat@@ ent, so that the overall period of protection is the exact term of the patent from the day when the drug is placed on the market.
We have been too rash in making compar@@ is@@ ons with the K@@ L@@ M flight that was eng@@ ul@@ fed in the volcan@@ ic dust of M@@ ount R@@ ed@@ ou@@ b@@ t over Al@@ as@@ ka in 198@@ 9 and too rash in making references to the British Air@@ ways flight which found itself in a cl@@ oud of volcan@@ ic dust over Indones@@ ia in 198@@ 2.
We have been forced to accept certain colour@@ ing agents in s@@ wee@@ ts and candi@@ es and in food products which could induce cancer and allerg@@ ies, especially in children.
S@@ ligh@@ tly to our surpris@@ e, as a member of the ST@@ O@@ A pan@@ el, there se@@ emed to be good technical means for control@@ ling what is on the Interne@@ t, for example, pornograph@@ y, so that you can signal areas which you need to investigate and look up.
Remember the Nap@@ ster and the New Tell cases.
We have had a trib@@ un@@ al, known as the L@@ ind@@ se@@ y trib@@ un@@ al, which was wound up recently, having s@@ at for some time trying to resolve the very tragic cases of patients, many of whom have since di@@ ed, who received infected blood.
We dem@@ anded that this period should be reduced to four years, with a maximum weekly working time of fif@@ ty@@ -f@@ our hours (@@ subject to negoti@@ ation) during that time.
We took the necessary steps immedi@@ ately, namely closing the buildings where the problems were observed.
Pa@@ ren@@ ts with difficulties in the country of origin have been included if they do not have any other family support. And adult children with health problems have also been included.
We obtained a total ban on all use of carc@@ asses and parts of dise@@ ased animals either as protein meal or, above all, as fat@@ .
It is 49 p@@ ages of high-@@ density non-@@ communic@@ ation.
There are indications of the distor@@ tions which can arise in the decis@@ ion@@ making process, and also of problems with implement@@ ation.
This is a clear contradic@@ tion@@ /@@ in@@ cohe@@ rence between what is recommended (for other@@ s) and what is done.
The two cases involving G@@ rig@@ ori Pas@@ ko and Ig@@ or S@@ ut@@ y@@ ag@@ in are more or less iden@@ tic@@ al.
We read today in communication CO@@ M (200@@ 2) 42@@ 2, which was presented yester@@ day, that a firm has imported sh@@ rim@@ ps with very high nitro@@ fur@@ an levels - 20 mg - from Viet@@ na@@ m via O@@ st@@ end into Germany and then on to Austria and Luxembourg as well as selling them in Germany.
We have not only required the additional B@@ +@@ E driving lic@@ ence for mobile hom@@ es and car@@ av@@ ans, but al@@ so, above a certain weight, a small test.
We did not just want week@@ ends of between 24 and 45 hours, but also 36 hours.
We have seen examples such as the town of Bu@@ ta, which was taken by one j@@ eep and three soldi@@ ers.
We obtained that sub-@@ head@@ ing: it is sub-@@ head@@ ing 3@@ a.
For example, we carried out a study on fit@@ ness centres which revealed that even teen@@ ag@@ ers - primarily young men between 15 and 17 years of age - are taking banned substances because they have seen the older ones doing so and because these substances are fre@@ ely available in some of these fit@@ ness cent@@ res.
For example, on page 17 we have Figure 17, which is about per@@ missible conf@@ ig@@ ur@@ ations for re@@ ar cor@@ ner se@@ ats, and shows a plan view of the prescribed seat area, with both re@@ ar cor@@ ner se@@ ats, in relation to Annex I Section 7.@@ 7.@@ 8.@@ 6.@@ 3.@@ 4, and as with aircraft design a maximum radi@@ us of 150 mm is prescri@@ bed.
For example, there is C@@ ry@@ st@@ al N@@ igh@@ t, which is important to remember in many countries, and we have the days around the end of the war in 19@@ 4@@ 5, which can also be important days to rememb@@ er.
We have allowed Bos@@ c@@ o N@@ t@@ ag@@ anda to take over the lead@@ ership of the CN@@ D@@ P from L@@ au@@ rent N@@ k@@ un@@ da@@ , although there is a warr@@ ant against Bos@@ c@@ o N@@ t@@ ag@@ and@@ a, and you see what happen@@ s.
L@@ ater we then notic@@ ed how proceedings were arbitr@@ arily initiated against dis@@ sid@@ ents, against cri@@ tics in the country from which they were able to escap@@ e.
We have a responsibility to ensure that events in this country do not '@@ fall off the rad@@ ar@@ '.
It is apparent that when the hur@@ ric@@ ane govern@@ s the oc@@ e@@ an, everything collap@@ ses.
This has of course been seen in the major accidents in Az@@ nal@@ c@@ ó@@ l@@ l@@ ar in Spain, in@@  @@ 199@@ 8, and also in Ba@@ ia M@@ are in Rom@@ ania, in@@  @@ 2000, when tail@@ ings pon@@ ds bur@@ st, releasing large quantities of toxic substances.
We have been able to tackle the problem of the possibility of maternal transmission by also taking out those animals that might be at risk because of their anc@@ estr@@ y.
We have concerns – although th@@ ank@@ fully some of them have been met – with regard to the protection and integr@@ ity of data, ver@@ ification by the passp@@ ort holder of that data, the inser@@ tion of any correc@@ tions necessary, and restrictions on the use of the passp@@ ort and the data.
We ga@@ thered data on the release of radioactive ca@@ es@@ ium throughout the EU following the accident.

We have got more than 3@@ 15 deep@@ water well@@ s, i.e. well@@ s over 300 metres deep@@ , while some of them have been up to 1 600 metres deep@@ .
We conc@@ ed@@ e that the EE@@ V@@ C tests can be subject to a further vi@@ ability study (@@ like the alternative measures which the industry may present@@ ).
We are ent@@ ru@@ st@@ ing peac@@ e@@ keeping in that area to those whose attempts at dec@@ ol@@ on@@ isation have resulted in f@@ ou@@ l massac@@ res which are worse than those of the colon@@ ial period.
We know what these factors are: they are the mos@@ ques and Islamic cent@@ res.
There is widespread awareness of the difficulties involved in developing phys@@ ic@@ o@@ chemical and biological techniques to determine the concentration of tox@@ ins in shell@@ fish. This is also the case regarding licen@@ sing the sale of vaccines in Member States.
The Union of My@@ an@@ mar@@ , form@@ er@@ ly known as Bur@@ ma, is familiar to us from images of ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite Bud@@ d@@ h@@ ist tem@@ ples and gol@@ d-@@ enc@@ ru@@ st@@ ed, sump@@ tu@@ ous pal@@ ac@@ es.
We have cases of workers being expected to work for 12 hours per day, 7 days a week for EUR 1 per hour.

We know what it means for a family if the mother is sick or di@@ es.
We know of the G@@ ul@@ f W@@ ar syndrome and the Balk@@ ans syndrome@@ ; time and again the same phenomen@@ on has been observ@@ able, with com@@ bat@@ ants evid@@ ently contr@@ acting canc@@ ers, such as lung cancer, because of their exposure to D@@ U ox@@ ide.
We all know about the special way of enrich@@ ing w@@ ines in Bar@@ ri@@ ques@@ ; it is an old tradi@@ tion, but one justified by the fact that storage in wood@@ en barrels has a positive effect on the w@@ ine@@ ’s mat@@ uration process.
We all know the par@@ able of the mot@@ e and the be@@ am.
We are all familiar with th@@ r@@ ill@@ ers where the psych@@ ologist is called in to draw up a criminal profile of the murder suspec@@ t; and if a wit@@ ness gives a clear desc@@ rip@@ tion, a profile - of a bank rob@@ b@@ er, let us say: white, male and 30 - it would be non@@ sense to ar@@ rest someone who was Asi@@ an, female and about 50.
Fin@@ ally, we will know the proven@@ ance of products such as por@@ k, long-@@ life milk, fru@@ it, veget@@ ables and some drin@@ ks, such as or@@ ang@@ e@@ ade.
We could see a similar development to that in t@@ elec@@ ommunic@@ ations, where technology has actually forced a change in the structure of the system.
As a result, we are sp@@ ending large amounts on treatment and vaccination.
Moreover, we consider efficiency tests for he@@ at@@ ers to be both necessary and important as the quality of fitted he@@ at@@ ers must be quanti@@ fi@@ able, for example whether the eng@@ ine cool@@ ant can be brought to operating temperature before the eng@@ ine is started.

For these reasons we think that euro co@@ ins should be nick@@ el@@ -f@@ re@@ e, that the den@@ omin@@ ations should be of different sizes and that the co@@ in should have room for national design@@ s on one side.
We believe that the human body and any organs or substances obtained from it are in@@ ali@@ enable and non-@@ market@@ able.
We note that in the Al@@ ps, the gl@@ aci@@ ers have been mel@@ ting since 18@@ 20.
For example, there are significant differences in the rules on tar@@ iff classi@@ fic@@ ation, value and origin - pre@@ fe@@ ren@@ tial and non-@@ pre@@ fe@@ ren@@ tial - of good@@ s.
We will continue to fight on this road@@ , which W@@ alter H@@ all@@ ste@@ in described as construc@@ ti@@ o continu@@ a, and which Je@@ an Mon@@ net spoke of as '@@ step by step@@ '.
We will also be very carefully monitoring the number of assist@@ ants helping out Qu@@ a@@ est@@ ors.

We run towards it cr@@ ying '@@ flu@@ , flu@@ ', and the som@@ bre@@ ro lif@@ ts slowly and the Council rep@@ lies '@@ ma@@ ñ@@ ana ma@@ ñ@@ an@@ a' and goes back to its si@@ est@@ a.

We disc@@ over the presence of prohib@@ ited, toxic@@ , and carcinogenic pharmaceuticals in sh@@ rim@@ ps and other products – and we re@@ act.
We are making the way straight for Turk@@ ey@@ !
We therefore ask the Commission to put forwar@@ d, within a certain period, a positive list of filtr@@ ation adjuv@@ ants, precipit@@ ation agents and absorption adjuv@@ ants.
We think it is vital for this meeting to take place at least four to six weeks before an appoint@@ ment is agreed for the operation, so as to give the women concerned a cool@@ ing-@@ off period to reflect on the objective and reliable information that they have receiv@@ ed.
We demand that a full investigation be carried out and that the perpetr@@ ators be pro@@ secut@@ ed, and simil@@ arly for the kill@@ ers of Gener@@ als Man@@ é and Cor@@ re@@ ia, killed in 2000 and 200@@ 4, who remain un@@ identified to this day.
We are making an exception for the reasons out@@ lined by the rapporteur@@ ...
We are also developing another sugges@@ tion of that expert group, the Man@@ aging Change Report@@ .
Protec@@ ting ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ s and the pol@@ ar cap from uncontrolled human intervention is an absolute mu@@ st.
We must help the po@@ or, the op@@ pressed and the power@@ less before they become desper@@ ate, suicidal terrorist@@ s.
We need to improve the service of information to women, both younger and ol@@ der, about the risks of and availability of treatment for breast cancer in order to ultimately reduce the mortality rate of women and to improve their quality of life and ass@@ ist them in retur@@ ning to work if they so des@@ i@@ re.
We need to study these findings carefully to conclude whether there is sufficient evidence for such a relation@@ ship.
Both at the national level and together, there is much to be done.
We also need to help the country change from its heavy use of ag@@ ro@@ chemic@@ als, its diver@@ sion of ri@@ vers and its poor dra@@ in@@ age system.
We must also hon@@ est@@ ly recognise the fact that there is much room for improvement in the way movements of waste in the European Union and away from it are controlled, according to the surveys that have been conducted.
The whole dec@@ k needs re@@ sh@@ uff@@ ling.
We need to be su@@ re, during the transition period for inspec@@ tion, that the reasons why these have been used, and used effec@@ tivel@@ y, are fully understood by the Commission and that they are not simply arbitr@@ arily removed from the sc@@ ene.
We have to face up to the fact that support for SME@@ s is an un@@ equal rac@@ e, one between A@@ chil@@ les and the tor@@ to@@ ise, or between the h@@ are and the h@@ ed@@ ge@@ ho@@ g in the German f@@ able, but unfortun@@ ately without the help of mistak@@ en@@ ly thinking that movement involves small, inter@@ mit@@ tent steps and without the help of the h@@ ed@@ ge@@ h@@ og@@ 's lo@@ ving wife and compan@@ ion.
There is a need for the use of antibiotics and medicines to be more closely monito@@ red, and also for a system to be established and data assemb@@ led for the purposes of health protec@@ tion.
We must ask the Commission to don its refe@@ re@@ e's out@@ fit and take off the Council shir@@ t that it has been we@@ aring these last three years.
We must therefore stri@@ ve to prevent the routine use of antibiotics - and also other medicinal preparations - in feed either as growth promo@@ ters or to prevent disease.
We must therefore streng@@ then the voice of obese and overweight patients.
Therefore we have to find some way to allow the proc@@ ure@@ ment to begin before the cris@@ is-@@ management operation is form@@ ally adopted so that the supplies are available as soon as the operation star@@ ts, or very shor@@ tly thereafter.
We also need to emphas@@ ise the possibility of a fast@@ -@@ track procedure, which reduces the time needed for administration, and it is also important that veterin@@ ari@@ ans thus have much more rapid access to the medicinal products.
We must also address the activities that go on in European mos@@ ques@@ : in recent days, not just in Rome but throughout Europe, hundreds if not thousands of mos@@ ques have been holding pra@@ y@@ ers for S@@ he@@ ik@@ h Y@@ ass@@ in, the the@@ or@@ ist and in@@ stig@@ ator of suicide bomb@@ ings and terrorist mur@@ ders.
We should also re@@ alise that the development of medicines for children should not be based on the premis@@ e – already mentioned several times before – that a@@  @@ child is just a@@  @@ reduced version of an adul@@ t.
What we have to prev@@ ent, therefore, is the mixing together of diox@@ in-@@ containing substances or at least ensure that such substances do not enter the animal feed chain via another route in spite of sufficient controls.
There is a need to list@@ en, for Europe must be both useful and protec@@ tive.
We must ensure that the burden to take back W@@ EE@@ E rest@@ s with the manufacture@@ s, not the re@@ tail@@ ers.
We must ensure that more is done to secure research and innov@@ ation, giving as many people as possible access to the best in cancer prevention and treatment.
We need to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude does not occur again.
We should exercise great caution in taking any subsequent step@@ s, and avoid any premature or rash decisions.
We need to breathe life into the rol@@ es, then the sp@@ ark will once again be passed on.
We need to breathe new life into the TE@@ C.
The possibility of developing different services in all parts of the spectrum must be fre@@ ed up.
We must limit the influence of pharmaceutical companies, not just as regards distribution, but also the carrying out of studies into vaccines and antiviral medic@@ ations.
MS patients deser@@ ve better.
Ob@@ ser@@ vers must be in place without delay in order to reduce the risk of incid@@ ents.
We should not forget that the divis@@ ions it brought to light cannot be described in simple term@@ s, with the ‘@@ go@@ odi@@ es’ on one side of the bar@@ ric@@ ades and the ‘@@ b@@ addi@@ es’ on the other.
We should therefore as@@ sure financial support to children@@ ’s immunisation programmes providing antigens to diphther@@ ia, tetanus and other infectious diseases.
We need to be careful@@ , for example, to look at the situation in the UK, where if you are pro@@ secu@@ ted you appear in the pap@@ er, but if minor infring@@ ements are disc@@ overe@@ d, such as a cr@@ ack@@ ed tile in a slaugh@@ ter@@ house or a piece of mou@@ se di@@ r@@ t in a restaur@@ ant, this does not appear on the front page of the local newspap@@ er.
The clos@@ est attention must be paid to ensuring that any products and resulting compounds whose disposal can have serious consequenc@@ es, particularly illness@@ es, cannot be produced or put on the market in the first place.
We must allow research to continue in order to relieve the suffering of the millions with serious diseases and spinal injuri@@ es, Alzheimer@@ '@@ s, Parkinson@@ '@@ s, motor neur@@ one disease, diabetes, cancer, heart diseas@@ e: the list is end@@ less.
We have to be aware that the growing pl@@ ague of aggression, mental disorders, under@@ developed person@@ alities and addic@@ tions is a result not only of a h@@ ed@@ on@@ istic lifestyle but also stems from the domin@@ ance of a materi@@ alis@@ tic world view which does not appreci@@ ate the role of spir@@ it@@ ual development in the individu@@ al.
Specific measures are needed on our part in the form of the provision of food, medicine and aid work@@ ers.
The overall effects need to be looked at.
We do have to take into account the extensive use, for very young children in particular, of products which have been flav@@ oured and sweet@@ ened in this way.
We should provide measures on how to cope even if there is a bomb@@ ing of pip@@ elines or electricity transmission wi@@ res.
We must react as soon as we can measure the fact that a pesticide or its breakdown product has penetr@@ ated the root zone of the earth@@ ’s cru@@ st.
We must revis@@ e and improve the monitoring mechanisms for detec@@ ting dangerous to@@ ys, due to substances that are considered to be carcinogen@@ ic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction (C@@ M@@ R substanc@@ es), frag@@ r@@ anc@@ es, or other dangerous substances, such as he@@ ter@@ opol@@ y@@ an@@ ion (H@@ PA@@ ) compoun@@ ds.
We need to know, for example, is this product univer@@ sal in application, is it to be used with one specific medicine, is it to be used with different types of medicin@@ es?
We have to know what the cost and effect, the damage or the benefit will be to those who fl@@ y, be it as a h@@ ob@@ b@@ y, on business or for any other reas@@ on.
We must all be aware that chemic@@ als, through the different steps from their production to their hand@@ ling, transport and use can pose potential risks to human health and the environment.
However, we must be aware that all of these measures are very much in their early stag@@ es.
Nevertheless, we have to make sure that this regulation does not increase the number of tests on verte@@ b@@ rate animals for the purpose of harmon@@ ising the classi@@ fication criter@@ ia, but that they shall be performed only if there are no alternative solutions guarante@@ eing the same quality.
Nevertheless, we also need to ensure that consumers do not run the risk of substantially exceeding the daily requirement of food supplements when they take a daily vitamin table@@ t.
We must use vaccination as a first method of dealing with an out@@ break@@ , at the same time, in conjunction with and al@@ ongside slaugh@@ ter.
We need to ensure that the recommended age for toys is based on child behaviour studies.
We have to ensure that the whole system of trace@@ ability, of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food cha@@ in, is part of that confid@@ enc@@ e-@@ building mechan@@ ism.
We must take care to ensure that any new irrig@@ ation schem@@ es are properly design@@ ed, with concre@@ te@@ -@@ lined chann@@ els and reservo@@ ir@@ s, and dro@@ ple@@ t irrig@@ ation systems similar to those used by farmers in Spain.
We have to be careful not to set the country up as too much of a scapego@@ at.
We should now consider a fresh start that is likely to produce a work@@ able solution, although I accep@@ t, reg@@ ret@@ tab@@ ly, that this is unlikely.
We should therefore seek effective solutions to the cases and activities which require them, such as those involved in the judg@@ ments mentioned here, Sim@@ ap or J@@ ä@@ g@@ er, but with objective criteria and conditions, to be used generally and in a non-@@ ab@@ us@@ ive fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ; and under no circumstances turning the exception into the general ru@@ le.
A daily intake of 600 grams for people 11@@ + should be our targ@@ et.
Cur@@ rently we have three different tests which have been found to give excell@@ ent results when used to test animals with clinical signs of disease after their death.
We now have scientific proof that one hormone in particular is carcinogen@@ ic, while there is a strong possibility that a further five are also carcinogen@@ s.
There is now in@@ disput@@ able scientific evidence that the Mediterranean diet - based on the traditional dietary intake of citizens of the sou@@ thern parts of Europe, such as Cre@@ te and Cy@@ p@@ rus - leads to a longer and health@@ ier life, whereas the Americ@@ an-@@ influ@@ enced j@@ un@@ k food diet - such as industri@@ ally processed ha@@ mb@@ urg@@ ers, chi@@ ps and s@@ wee@@ ts - leaders to a shorter life and one more affected by disease.
We have been informed that ir@@ radi@@ ated waste is being stored in a surface storage facil@@ ity, but that final storage has not yet been dec@@ ided.
We have some very successful alternatives such as adult stem cells and research on um@@ bil@@ ic@@ al-@@ cor@@ d blood cells.
We have certain statis@@ tics, but given the areas where the virus usually occurs and is en@@ dem@@ ic, the reporting and monitoring is not as effective as in some other areas.
We know far too lit@@ t@@ le, for example, about the effects of heavy consumption of sweet@@ en@@ ers during pregnancy or on the health of infants and children.
Technolog@@ y is available to ensure that windo@@ ws made of old lead@@ -containing PVC are over@@ laid with new PVC so people do not come into contact with it.
Cent@@ r@@ ally-@@ directed solutions are in order here.
We have cases of vill@@ ages alleg@@ edly being clean@@ sed 33 times - and another place 27 times - with around a sevent@@ h of the population being killed each time.
We have at our disposal works such as A Green Hist@@ ory of the World by C@@ live P@@ on@@ ting or the writ@@ ings of the French histor@@ ian Em@@ man@@ u@@ el le Ro@@ y La@@ du@@ ri@@ e.
We have in place an effective system of monitoring in order to ensure the rapid identi@@ fic@@ ation, assessment and handling of rare diseases and disease cl@@ ust@@ ers, and they would be an important matter al@@ so.
This is perhaps the first time in human history that we have fore@@ warn@@ ing, that we have certain mess@@ ages that such a pandemic may occur.

It is also doub@@ t@@ ful whether an experim@@ ent conducted over just three years can be described as a failure after such a short time.
We will also eliminate the other obstac@@ les which may occur.
We are pre@@ cluding research by small undertak@@ ings.
As a result, given that during the autum@@ n period there is a significant number of qu@@ a@@ il and tur@@ tle d@@ ov@@ es which is not very different from the number of birds hun@@ ted during the spring period and taking account of the judg@@ ments of the European Court of J@@ us@@ tic@@ e, we concluded that there is a satisfactory alternative and that the derog@@ ation is not therefore per@@ mis@@ sible.

We do not, and shall ne@@ ver, agree with any measure that clearly or sur@@ rep@@ ti@@ ti@@ ously attempts to introduce forms of advertis@@ ing, turning an ethical medicinal product into a commercial product.
We will not therefore appro@@ ve this web of hypocris@@ y and im@@ pot@@ ence.
We are not going to measure standards in Europe by how many people drive a Merc@@ ed@@ es 500@@ , but by how many children do not have a glass of milk to drink in the morning.
C@@ r@@ imin@@ alisation will not get us any@@ where.
We therefore do not go along with the excessive emphasis placed on promoting energy crops for obtaining biofu@@ els, given that such crops use scar@@ ce production factors like water and so@@ il, as well as various fertil@@ is@@ ers.
We do not often welcome M@@ IC@@ E into this Chamb@@ er, but the M@@ IC@@ E – the fun@@ d for paediatric medicine research – is very much to be welcom@@ ed.
We should expect no less for Indones@@ ia, with its A@@ ce@@ h separ@@ ati@@ sts.
There would then be no need for B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing + 10@@ !
We would not have luc@@ er@@ ne, which is used in cattle feed.
We do not allow people to drink and drive because their coordination is g@@ one.
We have not even stated in the document that there must be no loss of nutritional value or loss of vitamin@@ s.
We had not achieved such levels of confidence since the previous expan@@ sion@@ ary phase.
There h@@ as, after all, been only one case in which a vehicle manufacturer has brought an action against another manufacturer for design@@ -@@ right infring@@ ement in the primary market, despite the fact that there have actually been some very stri@@ king similar@@ ities between models produced by different manufacturer@@ s.
We have no solid proof that they are yet affecting humans but there are many indicators such as the decline in sperm counts, and the rise in tes@@ ticular and breast cancer.
We have no sympath@@ y with the mut@@ in@@ ies by the I@@ vor@@ ian arm@@ y, which was formed and to a certain extent m@@ oul@@ ded by French soldiers and which, since its inc@@ ep@@ tion, has had no other purpose for existing but to op@@ press the poor majority of the I@@ vor@@ ian population whilst sub@@ mitting it to ex@@ tor@@ tion and r@@ ack@@ et@@ e@@ ering along the way.
We do not have any drug that is able to destroy the virus and, as a result, in the West and in Europe, we have seen a decrease in mortality and an increase in the number of people living with the HIV virus, who can technically be described as '@@ potential vec@@ tors of infection@@ '.
There have been no problems raised as a result of people having been excluded by the use of the definition - at least no major problems.
It only half-@@ list@@ en@@ ed.
We do not need this new technology to produce more food into a market which is already over@@ suppli@@ ed.
We have no defined limits for the addition of water to w@@ ine, but, for example, a limit of 7% has been defined in respect of adding water to concentr@@ ated grap@@ es, as it is impossible to detect the addition of water below that thresh@@ old.
We do not have a fix@@ ed, pre@@ conce@@ ived idea of who gets wh@@ at.
No decisions could be taken regarding any modi@@ fic@@ ations, or anything of that kin@@ d, because no one in the Commission asked for an@@ y.
It was not done with EU schem@@ es: this all began before the UK joined the then EC@@ .
We did not, however, support the option of a fixed four@@ - or fiv@@ e- month SPC exten@@ sion, because this risks being un@@ fair to smaller companies.
The long-term effects of the use of ec@@ stas@@ y are still very much unknown, other than we know that ec@@ stas@@ y is still a drug that can cause depression and mem@@ ory impairment.
There are no statistics available, but there is no evidence of cann@@ ib@@ alism.
It is not clear yet what the specific results will be following this vis@@ it.
We do not yet know the implic@@ ations of this decis@@ ion, which is based on an emotional reaction to reconstituted meat and not on a scientific assessment of the actual enzy@@ me.
It got out of control. We do not know its effect on human health if an@@ y.
We do not discour@@ age vaccination.
We need not discuss the safety defects in B@@ oh@@ un@@ ice, although perhaps I may raise just three of the most important point@@ s: as be@@ fore, there is no replacement for the missing reinforced concrete and no pressure suppression system or other safety system@@ s; the up@@ grad@@ ing is inadequate se@@ ism@@ olog@@ ic@@ all@@ y; and the re@@ actor pressure container is so b@@ rit@@ tle that the possibility of bur@@ st@@ ing cannot be excluded.
We should not unde@@ restim@@ ate those health risks, which include stomach and abdominal disorders, skin, eye and respiratory tract complaints and outer ear infections.
We should not include organs in this measure on cells and tissues.
We should not forget that there is no prophylaxis or treatment for trans@@ missible and bovine spon@@ gi@@ form encephal@@ opath@@ ies in either humans or animals, that these diseases are always fat@@ al, and that the impact chain with regard to the formation of these dead@@ ly pri@@ ons has not yet been fully research@@ ed by scienti@@ sts.
There is no data on the projec@@ ted costs to carri@@ ers; no assessment of the impact on competitiv@@ eness - between both EU and other carri@@ ers; and no information on the direct and consequ@@ ential impact of this legislation.
No scientific data are available on what residual amount of a given allerg@@ en may trig@@ ger an allergic reaction.
There is no available scientific basis that demonstr@@ ates either that the derivatives of certain aller@@ gens are still aller@@ gen@@ ic, or that they are no longer likely to cause adverse reactions.
We do not yet have any final data for 2005, but I expect no greater reduction for that year than for 2004.
Nor do we have any information on substitutes to plas@@ tic@@ isers which might have toxic or chronic effects.
We are not only speaking about CD@@ s and hand@@ bag@@ s, but also machin@@ ery and hi@@ -@@ tec@@ h products.
We are not paying any state assistance for the capacity that remain@@ s.
We do not make similar calls in the case of E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia, since it would be all too obvious that they are point@@ less.
This is not required for other groups, so why the web@@ -@@ blo@@ g@@ g@@ ers?
There is no lack of information from us.
The min@@ es have not just been left in the ground un@@ supervis@@ ed: they are in storage and guar@@ ded.
No longer do we hear the sound of b@@ ell@@ s or b@@ ark@@ ing dogs.
We shall only be land@@ ing 25 000 tonnes of d@@ j@@ ab@@ o@@ ï as a by-@@ cat@@ ch, so as not to discard it.
In our opinion, a simpli@@ fied registration procedure should not be used either for medicines for human use or those for veterinary use, which can enter the food cha@@ in.
We cannot have any repe@@ ti@@ tion of the situation in Germany, for example, where babies only a few months old have been taken away from their mothers because there are no mother and child places available in pris@@ on, leading to months of separ@@ ation.
We therefore cannot support the proposal that clinical trials of medicinal products can be begun if authorisation has not been given by the expiry of the time limit.
It is unacceptable to us that clinical trials of medicinal products for human use can be started under any circumstances without being directly authorised by the Member States, but simply once the authorities have been noti@@ fied.
We cannot pre@@ clude the possibility that the new generation of insec@@ tic@@ ides applied mainly using the method of im@@ mer@@ sing se@@ eds is harmful to the environment and public health, especially when these preparations are used in different countries and after ger@@ min@@ ation in order to combat certain plant en@@ em@@ ies, with the result that their residues are greater during b@@ los@@ som@@ ing and in the final product.
We cannot limit the spreading of man@@ ure only in cases where it is suspected of dissemin@@ ating an O@@ I@@ E List A disease, as certain Member States have additional eradic@@ ation measures for diseases not included in that list@@ , such as salmon@@ ell@@ a.
We cannot forget that a considerable number of workers suffer from the effects of their exposure to vi@@ br@@ ations, notably neuro@@ log@@ ical, vascular and mus@@ cu@@ lo@@ -@@ skeletal disorders.
It cannot be the case that children can take up many times the quantity of carcinogenic substances in just one hour of skin contact than are contained in the smoke from 40 cigarett@@ es.
Ex@@ pan@@ sion must not be used as a scapego@@ at.
It is not proper to ask Egyp@@ t, which already ac@@ commod@@ ates between two and thre@@ e@@  million Sud@@ an@@ ese, of whom 27@@  000 are registered with the H@@ CR@@ , to receive all of the refugees from that country.
It cannot be reduced to an el@@ ite the@@ at@@ re set where first-@@ night perform@@ ances of any old small prov@@ in@@ cial the@@ at@@ re production are put on free of charg@@ e.
We cannot talk in generalised terms about the over@@ capacity or the over@@ fishing or the lack of compli@@ ance.
We simply cannot allow scientific progress and the potential treatments that result to er@@ od@@ e ethical b@@ ound@@ ari@@ es.
We can only watch as the number of check points increases rather than decreas@@ es.
We cannot help feeling susp@@ icious about the way these posts are to be fil@@ led, given that it will be mainly by '@@ re@@ dep@@ loy@@ ment@@ ' and '@@ ration@@ alis@@ ation' rather than recruit@@ ment.
We cannot accept that there should be first@@ - and second-@@ class patients: they must all be equ@@ al, regardless of sex@@ , age, place of resid@@ ence or any other criter@@ ion.
We are not prescribing a specific instrum@@ ent@@ ; that is for you to do.
At that time, we received pit@@ ying smil@@ es.
We do not even know into what matrix we are squeez@@ ing it, let alone how to evaluate and set the criteria for the long-term safety of nuclear storage sites.
It is not clear how G@@ EE@@ RE@@ F financing is going to filter down to Commun@@ ity-@@ level projects such as PV pan@@ els for health centres and schools or sol@@ ar co@@ ok@@ ers and water he@@ at@@ ers.
Less clear, however, is why the production of protein has to be reduced too in the light of an increase in demand on the European market.
Maybe we will not even be medi@@ ators there but facilit@@ ators.
Further surpris@@ es can never be ruled out.
This is not the moment of the O@@ s@@ lo agre@@ ements, or the el@@ ation in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton or Cas@@ ab@@ l@@ anc@@ a - this is not a moment for el@@ ation.
Individu@@ als are not exposed to ker@@ b side concentrations continu@@ ously. It is the building line which is important and that may be more than five metres from the ker@@ b.
We are not in the business of kne@@ e-@@ j@@ er@@ k reactions and respon@@ ses.
We are not in favour of the proposal from the Committee on the Environ@@ ment to double the limit value for the carcinogenic tri@@ hal@@ ome@@ than@@ es to 110 microgram@@ mes per lit@@ re, in excess even of the Commission proposal.
It is not clear whether daily access to the medical treatment he needs is guaranteed and whether he can count on doctor@@ s' assistance during his detention in the B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing Mun@@ ic@@ ip@@ al D@@ et@@ en@@ tion Centre in Dou@@ ge@@ z@@ hu@@ ang@@ .
We are not all un@@ educ@@ ated and ill@@ iter@@ ate.
This is no longer the scenari@@ o.
We are only 50, maybe 60 people maxim@@ um, out of 7@@ 85 MEP@@ s.
We do not support the Commission's view that all new active substances for veterinary medicinal products should be authorised under the centralised procedure.
International aid must, without fail@@ , be well coordin@@ ated.
This is not some kind of agricultural mar@@ ath@@ on, where one has to adj@@ u@@ dic@@ ate between carro@@ ts and turn@@ ip@@ s.
We would not want to be treated by a dr@@ un@@ ken doctor and I do not believe that we should be treated by an over-@@ tired doctor.
We should not have GMOs containing antibiotics or resistant gen@@ es, or GMOs which can cross-@@ pol@@ lin@@ ate with their c@@ ous@@ ins in the w@@ il@@ d.
We do not want to be involved in the stig@@ mati@@ sing of alcoholic drinks with the sole exception of areas where new products may present a health hazard for the un@@ war@@ y.
We do not want the cohes@@ ion policies to be compared to Em@@ mental che@@ ese, which looks very comp@@ act on the out@@ side.
No more pseud@@ o-@@ prud@@ ential protection@@ ism, pleas@@ e!
No more sof@@ tly, sof@@ tly on Hel@@ m@@ s-@@ Bur@@ ton.
We have no reason to keep it on or take it off.
H@@ ard@@ ly any GMOs are being export@@ ed, at the very most products produced by means of them.
Results will not be achieved either easily or immedi@@ atel@@ y; it will take some time.
N@@ ous n@@ '@@ ou@@ bli@@ er@@ ons j@@ am@@ a@@ is.
It was expected that EF@@ SA would not find clear safety concerns related to food products from cl@@ ones of farm animals, compared with conven@@ tion@@ ally-@@ b@@ red animals.
C@@ lim@@ ate change is expected to lead to a reduction in ra@@ inf@@ all, higher temperatures and a higher incidence of heat wav@@ es and periods of drough@@ t, leading to increased deser@@ tific@@ ation.
We expect inflation for the remaining months of this year to h@@ over around this level of 2%, then early next year, mainly due to base effects, to fall significantly below the 2% limit and then, later on next year and in 2005, to clim@@ b back somewhat in a direction that will bring it close to 2@@ %.
We are fl@@ ying to D@@ ha@@ ka tomor@@ ro@@ w, in order to ga@@ ther first-@@ hand information about the situation in C@@ ox@@ 's B@@ az@@ ar and the B@@ and@@ ar@@ ban region.
We are concerned about the relatively short duration of the authorisation granted to service provi@@ ders (5 to 10 years) and the re@@ introduction of financial incen@@ tives.
We are very concerned about those areas in which no significant improvement has been observed.
We are concerned also at the increased number of reported cases of tor@@ ture and ill-@@ treatment, in particular, outside official places of de@@ ten@@ tion.
We are also won@@ dering about safety with regard to the use of wh@@ ol@@ ly or par@@ tly genetically modified food@@ s, and about the weight of that problem with regard to baby food@@ s, pharmaceutical products or products on general sale such as vitamins or integr@@ ators containing animal gel@@ atin@@ es.
We like to think of the United Kingdom as a rich country, but one in five pension@@ ers are in low-@@ income house@@ hol@@ d@@ s; the in@@ comes of those over 75 are lower stil@@ l.
We are particularly concerned that the consumer will be exposed to the risk of a break in the sales and after@@ -@@ sales service link if the distrib@@ ut@@ or is able to aw@@ ard after@@ -@@ sales service contracts to authorised repa@@ i@@ rers which are not subject to a location cl@@ a@@ use.
We especially welcome point 1 of Annex I (@@ respect of the principle of non-@@ ref@@ ou@@ le@@ ment, the consideration of the special needs of vulnerable persons and those who are in need of urgent medical assist@@ ance, training for border guar@@ ds in human rights and refuge@@ e law@@ ) as well as points 3 and 4 (including consideration of the migr@@ ant@@ 's situ@@ ation, taking into account their possible requests for assistance or the se@@ a@@ worth@@ iness of the ship, no dise@@ mb@@ ark@@ ation in countries where persons risk being per@@ secu@@ ted and tor@@ ture@@ d) mentioned in Annex II.
We are presented with a lu@@ dic@@ rous situation in which the re@@ patri@@ ation of a cor@@ p@@ se from Sal@@ z@@ burg to Fre@@ il@@ ass@@ ing – a distance of ten kilometres – requires a zinc co@@ ff@@ in, but the transfer of a body from I@@ val@@ o to Hel@@ sin@@ ki – a distance of 11@@ 20 kilometres – requires no such co@@ ff@@ in.
We have a situation where ab@@ und@@ ant information is available on the web@@ , which is not valid@@ ated and makes the consumer extremely un@@ su@@ re, which concentr@@ ates on products which are not on the market and which conf@@ uses many citizens when they visit their doct@@ ors.
Data processing and sat@@ ellit@@ es are not yet fully util@@ ised.
We no longer use therm@@ ome@@ ters containing mercur@@ y, and am@@ al@@ g@@ am is generally not used for repa@@ iring our te@@ eth@@ .
We are making slow and painful head@@ way.
We place patients who are already in a difficult situation in the position of beg@@ g@@ ars who have to find spon@@ sors in order to obtain treatment.
We constantly hear shoc@@ king information, such as that sof@@ ten@@ ers can also find their way into the food cha@@ in, as they can be absorbed in fatty food@@ s.
We are also allowing for the granting of partial decom@@ mission@@ ing.
No situation is free from risk. Wor@@ se, that risk is sometimes hid@@ den@@ , not immediately obvi@@ ous, does not stri@@ ke us at onc@@ e, and is difficult to detec@@ t.
We talk much about education and its out@@ standing role in changing attit@@ ud@@ es, cont@@ our@@ ing behaviour@@ s, integration of groups with high risk of margin@@ alisation and development of commun@@ ities.
We are talking about red traffic lights and spe@@ ed@@ ing, but we are not talking about the operation of traffic lights or roun@@ dab@@ ou@@ ts, or about not using mobile ph@@ ones and smoking when dri@@ v@@ ing, or about driving courses in the European Union or general fin@@ es which would have shoc@@ ked even the most har@@ den@@ ed off@@ en@@ ders.
We are talking about protec@@ ting textile design@@ s, for example, or design@@ s in glass or plastic - all the types of design which may be involved in a given industrial product at a given time.
We are talking about substances causing neurological and hepatic disorders, of all th@@ ings, and they are not allowed to know any@@ thing.
We are discus@@ sing arom@@ ati@@ zed win@@ es, wine-@@ based drinks and wine-@@ product cock@@ tail@@ s.
We are talking about traffic not only in an@@ abolic steroid@@ s, stimul@@ ants, diuretics and hormon@@ es, but also in medicines used to treat a number of dangerous illness@@ es, which in this case are sold fre@@ ely and at a lower pr@@ ice, even though they require a prescription.
In fact, we are talking about a safety margin at least 50 times lower than the levels for which possible health effects have been established.
We often talk about the importance of the role of women, but there can be no st@@ ark@@ er an example than this of the damage that occurs when women are power@@ less.
The number of Member States is to increase from 15 to 25, and the number of MEP@@ s from 6@@ 26 to 7@@ 3@@ 2.
The price of your failure would be aw@@ ful.
‘@@ We pa@@ y, they sp@@ end@@ ’ simply will not do.
We thought we had war@@ ded off the dang@@ er, but soon after@@ war@@ ds, the coast@@ line of Gal@@ ic@@ ia was ru@@ ined by the tar from an even worse accident than the previous on@@ e: the Pre@@ stig@@ e.
We think of this in terms of swallowing something or str@@ ang@@ ul@@ ation, but there is a more cover@@ t kill@@ er and that is cancer.
It certainly seems to us that where the tec@@ ton@@ ic pl@@ ates of the world@@ ’s three great mono@@ the@@ istic relig@@ ions – Christi@@ an@@ ity, J@@ ud@@ a@@ ism and Is@@ la@@ m – are rubb@@ ing up against each other and causing sp@@ ark@@ s to fl@@ y, we need to proceed with extreme caution.
For example, we have in mind the introduction of exemp@@ tions from pilot service in ports where cap@@ tain@@ s can demonstrate they have a high level of experience.
One thinks of the so-called margin@@ ally conform@@ ing aircraf@@ t, which are equipped with h@@ ush@@ -@@ k@@ its that only margin@@ ally comply with the standard for C@@ hap@@ ter 3 aircraf@@ t.
We believe that this rule helps pharmac@@ ies carry out their difficult role in pharmacovigilance and education on the correct use of medicinal products.
It is our bel@@ ie@@ f that Regulation (EEC) No 40@@ 5@@ 6/@@ 86 cannot be del@@ eted without being replac@@ ed.
We found that the text was too wat@@ ered down (for example in the votes per@@ taining to par@@ . 3@@ 3).
We think it is essential that all applicant donors are fully aware of the risk that donated blood and plasma can trans@@ mit cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases.
We think that it is important to give children health@@ ier eating habit@@ s.
We believe it is necessary to exam@@ ine the possibility of warning consumers of such potential allergic reactions.
An industry is being maintained which is both harmful to public health and un@@ profit@@ able.
In terms of the most important factor of production - the human factor - we have top@@ -@@ quality resourc@@ es.
There may also be conce@@ iv@@ able scenari@@ os in which the New Yor@@ k stock exchange and a newly formed one joint with the L@@ SE or, on the other hand E@@ uron@@ ext and Deutsch@@ e B@@ ö@@ r@@ se might get together.
What might be a possibility is for us to set a limit of, for example, a 2% proportion of trans@@ -f@@ at@@ ty acids in total energy in@@ take.
We could restrict regional payments to recip@@ i@@ ents with a maximum not of 50, but of 100@@ , 200 or 500 and more hecta@@ res.
One could go on for hours about this sor@@ ry s@@ ag@@ a.
We could copy the example of the blue flag@@ .
However, we may be gl@@ ad that none of the patients infected with this virus in the EU has yet di@@ ed.
Po@@ si@@ tive examples are the B@@ ay of Bis@@ ca@@ y, the K@@ at@@ te@@ g@@ at and the Sk@@ ag@@ er@@ ra@@ k.
We can already see that in the new generation of aircraf@@ t: the Air@@ bus 3@@ 80 and the Boe@@ ing 78@@ 7.
Therefore, this covers 3 8@@ 30 cases, not 88@@ 5.
Amendment No 9 is also acceptable since it allows time-@@ limited exten@@ sions for the use of very small quantities of C@@ FC@@ s in a specialised type of medical devices for pain reli@@ ef@@ .
We can also rest assu@@ red that the products that Germany export@@ ed, and that were intended for the food manufacturing market, such as egg@@ s, were tested and found to contain very low levels of diox@@ ins, since they were mixed with other non German products in the food manufacturing process.
There might well be other causes for the increased number of fat@@ al@@ ities.
We can train the permanent staff of organisations who have to train the volunteers.
We can help with our experienc@@ e, and after C@@ astro@@ 's over@@ thro@@ w, the European Union should help with its experience and its mone@@ y, so that Cub@@ a never reaches the situ@@ ation, described by Polish com@@ ment@@ at@@ or, M@@ are@@ k Mag@@ i@@ er@@ ow@@ sk@@ i, in which in the future, the desc@@ end@@ ants of Or@@ land@@ o Z@@ ap@@ at@@ a, of whom frequent mention has been made in this Chamb@@ er, serve ru@@ m on the pro@@ men@@ ades and b@@ ou@@ lev@@ ards of Hav@@ ana to the desc@@ end@@ ants of C@@ astro@@ .
We also see how wage differences are not decreasing but increas@@ ing, both within one and the same workplace and between the sex@@ es.
Between the systems of authorisation and notification we favour the system of notification because with this system, when an application is submitted to the E@@ th@@ ics Committe@@ e, the regulatory authority will be noti@@ fied, and the investig@@ ator may comm@@ ence with the trial thereby cutting the bureauc@@ r@@ acy to a minim@@ um.
We take medicines to relieve pain, to alleviate the symptoms of diseases or to save our lives.
There is an overall short@@ age of foodstuffs and feeding@@ stuff@@ s, particularly of protein crop@@ s, and defic@@ its in the area of protein production.
Therefore, we present a monitoring system which ext@@ ends all the way from the manufacturer to the patient.
We claim that the proposed measures need to include systematic research with specific studies on women, since problems such as eating disorders, neuro@@ veget@@ ative diseases, schizophren@@ ia, depression and suicide have not yet been studied from a gender perspec@@ tive and that means that the progress made in prevention and treatment is less significant than is needed.
We also fore@@ see adop@@ ting specific technical rules with regard to the marg@@ ins of tolerance for the amounts of vitamins and minerals declared to be present in food supplement@@ s.
Memb@@ ership should be to the benefit of all Cy@@ pri@@ ot@@ s, however.
We really consider that aircraft inspections by organised engine@@ ers in accordance with Par@@ t-@@ 66 (A@@ ir@@ cr@@ aft Maintenance Per@@ son@@ nel L@@ ic@@ en@@ sing@@ ) need to be resto@@ red.
We proposed maintaining the support measures until the normal production capacity util@@ isation rate was resto@@ red.
We propose that this value should be lo@@ wered to 400 microgram@@ s.
The proposal is to replace the words '@@ so far@@ ' by '@@ except for the very last one on 31 October 20@@ 10@@ '.
We therefore propose a two-@@ stage regulation for PM@@ 2.@@ 5, with, in the first instance, a target value from 2010 on@@ war@@ ds, and, with effect from 2005, a limit value around 20@@  @@ microgram@@ s; this too, is more amb@@ iti@@ ous than what the Council and the Commission are propos@@ ing.
We propose that contribu@@ tions be calculated taking into account how hard the work is and the number of dependent children.
We propose accep@@ ting a combination of passive and active measures (which in any event could have been included in another direc@@ tiv@@ e@@ !@@ ) in the event that we replace the European Exper@@ im@@ ental Ve@@ hic@@ les Committee (E@@ EV@@ C) tests, provided that these passive measures do not constitute more than 25% of all the measures.
We propose a change to the method of data collection if results are not achieved within a certain period of time.
We objec@@ t to risks taken in transport to D@@ oun@@ re@@ ay for the following reason@@ s:
There will come a time when we will pub@@ lish forecast@@ s, either bi@@ -@@ ann@@ ually or tri@@ -@@ ann@@ u@@ ally.
We receive news from K@@ ok K@@ sor and the Mont@@ ag@@ n@@ ard F@@ ound@@ ation, for example on 28 April when Y@@ -@@ Ta@@ o E@@ ban was killed by Viet@@ nam@@ ese police and security forc@@ es, and on 15 April when two Mont@@ agu@@ ard D@@ eg@@ ar children were killed by four Viet@@ nam@@ ese police offic@@ ers.
We are receiving and monitoring reports on the san@@ itary conditions in these, the lack of food and the mental and physical ill-@@ treatment.
We all recognise that the system should not be over@@ burden@@ ed with too much bureaucrac@@ y, and we have acknowledged the need – certainly in some sectors – for self-@@ inspection or inspection with a light tou@@ ch.
We are afraid of having a '@@ wit@@ ch-@@ hun@@ t' when nam@@ ing and sha@@ ming is carried out.
In particular, we reject the amendments which would tend@@ , first of all, to make the statement on veget@@ able fat part of the name of the product or place it on the front of the product.
So the burden@@ , which is a common one, falls very un@@ equ@@ ally, with women taking a four@@ fold sha@@ re.
We repeat that it is nothing ne@@ w, whether in the reports on '@@ Women and industr@@ y@@ ', '@@ Women and health@@ ' or '@@ Women in rural are@@ as@@ '.
We will resist all temp@@ tation to drop one part or an@@ other, for to do so would jeop@@ ardis@@ e the roun@@ d@@ 's entire equ@@ il@@ ib@@ ri@@ um.
We therefore feel fru@@ str@@ ation, emo@@ tion and sad@@ ness as a result of the events of recent days.
It takes us back to a time in the 198@@ 0@@ s when an SA@@ S cab@@ in consist@@ ed only of corpor@@ ate execu@@ tives, politic@@ ians and union bos@@ ses.
With the proposal to allow sulph@@ ite in the production process for break@@ fast food@@ s, we are running the risk of sulph@@ ite residues reaching consumers without their being able to read on the product that it may contain sulph@@ ite, as sulph@@ ite is not included in the list of ingredi@@ ents.
Equ@@ ally pra@@ is@@ e@@ worthy are the results obtained with regard to medicine prices and the un@@ den@@ i@@ able vic@@ tory achieved over the ego@@ ism of the pharmaceutical multin@@ ation@@ als.
We also welcome the call for the Commission and the Member States to take every possible step to ensure that women finally receive a full explanation of the advantages and dis@@ advantages of hormone replacement therapy.
We also know that the feed concerned contains both zo@@ on@@ otic and other bacteria that are wh@@ ol@@ ly resistant to antibiotics.
We also know that European film@@ , particularly when produced in languages with few speak@@ ers, cannot easily maintain as large a film production as one would wish@@ .
We also know that the rate of HIV among male prison@@ ers is 15 times higher than among the general population.
We know this and also we know, and it has been proven@@ , that early detection of cancer can significantly reduce cancer mortal@@ ity.
We already know what this type of epidemic can lead to, particularly after the so-called '@@ tro@@ pic@@ al' gen@@ oc@@ ide in which 50 000 people were killed in the same region of G@@ om@@ a.
We have known since 1997 that the H@@ 5 sub-@@ type is highly cont@@ ag@@ i@@ ous, that it is capable of being transmitted to man and producing a form of influenza with a high death rate, but that so far transmission is only possible through contact with dise@@ ased birds and their excre@@ ment.
We have known for years that there is at least one hormone that is suspected of being carcinogenic and that the other hormones have particularly adverse effects on young people during puber@@ ty.
We have known for months that a number of antibiotics in animal feed produce forms of resistance in humans.
We know from experience that this has been successful@@ : production can be equally effici@@ ent, even if more care is exercised with regard to the animal@@ s' environment.
We already know that 3 000 children have been taken into the care of the authorities because their parents cannot provide for them.
We also know that the quantity of bro@@ min@@ ated flame retard@@ ants in breast milk has been increasing each year.
We also know that they have a very low reproductive capac@@ ity, and that there are around 8@@ 7 different species of fish sw@@ im@@ ming together at these great dep@@ th@@ s, of which only around eight are edi@@ ble or market@@ able.
We know in fact that as a whole, to gener@@ alis@@ e, the price of water colour@@ s is much lower than that for pa@@ int@@ ings and much higher than that for dra@@ w@@ ings.
We know - and a study published in The L@@ anc@@ et has demonstrated this once more - that heavy metals cause damage to the nervous system and also last@@ ing, ir@@ re@@ par@@ able brain damage, particularly in children.
We know, for instance, that the consumption of hormon@@ e-@@ treated meat is damaging to the development of adolescents during puber@@ ty.
We know for certain that the presence in the end product of traces of the a@@ ids used cannot be scientific@@ ally demonstr@@ ated, even though, in such small quanti@@ ties, they are unlikely to trig@@ ger allergies.
We rec@@ k@@ on that 5% of all hospital ad@@ missions are the result of adverse drug reactions and that adverse drug reactions cause a fifth of the unnecessary deaths in hospit@@ als.
We know that these drugs are easily transport@@ able and that they are not detectable using the means normally used to detect other drug@@ s.
We know that they are slow mat@@ ur@@ ing, not reaching breeding age sometimes until they are at least 25 years old, and they have a very low reproductive capac@@ ity.
We know that this is only the tip of the ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ , and that the number of un@@ reported cases of people being abduc@@ ted without any form of due process, subjected to the most cru@@ el tor@@ tures and then murdered is far great@@ er.
We know that in 50% of these cases this could have been avoided if the patient had been informed about the nature of the medicine they receiv@@ ed.
We know that there are dead bodies and 150 people are mis@@ sing.
We know that, from the technical stand@@ point in CO@@ AR@@ M (C@@ od@@ e of Con@@ duc@@ t on Ar@@ ms Ex@@ port@@ s), the work is done.
We know that the disease does not know and respect border@@ s, and this is particularly worrying in case of this dead@@ ly disease to which people have no antibodies.
We know that it is specifically with cann@@ ab@@ is that most people who end up mis@@ -@@ using hero@@ in, coc@@ a@@ ine and amph@@ et@@ am@@ ines beg@@ in.
We know that early diagnosis of this disease will increase the chances of a successful c@@ ure.
We know that early diagnosis is still the best method of improving pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis and treatment, and that early detection will make breast cancer easier to cure and less traum@@ atic for the patient.
We know that the most cost-@@ effective way to combat cancer is prevention, and yet there are Member States, including Hungary for example, where this year money is only being put into screening programmes for mouth, breast and cervical canc@@ ers, but not other types of cancer.
We know that AD@@ S is closely connected to excessive television consumption and over-@@ stimul@@ ation.
We do know that the EF@@ SA studies make repeated references to Mon@@ san@@ to.
We know that salmon@@ ella dis@@ appears in such products and only new contamination will re@@ introduce salmon@@ ella into them.
As we are awa@@ re, vaccines constitute an essential instrument when associated with bet@@ ter, cheap@@ er and more reliable tests for detec@@ ting the infection, as well as more efficient diagno@@ ses and treat@@ ments.
We know that the kind of fishing commonly carried out over sensitive deep@@ -@@ water ec@@ os@@ y@@ stems can be hor@@ ri@@ fic@@ ally de@@ struc@@ tive - col@@ d-@@ water cor@@ al, se@@ a-@@ moun@@ ts and hydro@@ ther@@ mal vents can be destroy@@ ed.
We know that obesity is one of the factors responsible for '@@ civil@@ isation diseas@@ es@@ ', such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and consequ@@ ent diseases of the musculoskeletal system.
We know that when you vaccin@@ ate cattle it can take up to 14 days before they develop immun@@ ity.
We know that you are also a leg@@ end@@ ary Member of Parliament, even if you were such as a journal@@ ist.
We know that there are more than 800 different pestic@@ ides, and many of these substances have carcinogenic or mutagenic effects and weak@@ en the immune system.
We know that the issu@@ ing of an authorisation for a medicinal product does not, however, mean that checks are no longer needed on its efficacy and safety.
We know that one in three Europeans is diagnosed with cancer during their life@@ time and that the most common diagno@@ ses are lung cancer, bowel cancer (which some people have mention@@ ed) and breast cancer.
We know that many of these flights were routine flights used to transport equipment or offici@@ als, but not all of them were: Ab@@ u O@@ mar@@ , Ma@@ her Ar@@ ar, K@@ hal@@ ed el@@ -M@@ as@@ ri@@ , Mo@@ ha@@ med Al@@ gi@@ za and many others were roughly loaded onto and transported in these aircraft to their prison@@ s.
We are all aware of how often Je@@ ws have been per@@ secu@@ ted for mar@@ rying non-@@ Je@@ w@@ s, and how often white people have been per@@ secu@@ ted for mar@@ rying black people, and such per@@ sec@@ ution has always been carried out under the pre@@ text of cultural in@@ compati@@ bil@@ ity.
We all know that oil was first produced in 19@@ 68 from Pr@@ ud@@ ho@@ e B@@ ay on the Al@@ ask@@ an North Slo@@ pe@@ , but many areas of the Ar@@ c@@ tic have not yet been explo@@ red.
It is well known that PVC may present a risk when used in toys for young children.
We all know that tobacco is harmful to people's health@@ ; lung cancer, circul@@ atory and heart diseases, cancer of the lar@@ yn@@ x, cancer of the tongue, cancer of the stomach and of the intest@@ ine are very frequently the scientific@@ ally proven consequ@@ ence.
We know full well that as yet there is no toxic@@ ology study that evalu@@ ates the consequences of releasing GMOs into the environment.
Therefore, we have certain@@ ty that anyone who is given such a lic@@ ence is a good driver of a m@@ op@@ ed, a motor@@ cycle@@ , a car or a lor@@ r@@ y.
In this way, we will be able to avoid un@@ even responses and the preval@@ ence of un@@ equal conditions regarding access and treatment for the disease.
We will also take care to ensure that the current scientific uncertain@@ ty as regards se@@ di@@ ments and bi@@ ot@@ a will not create a kind of soft focus that will in the long term exemp@@ t the European Union from en@@ de@@ av@@ our@@ ing to understand and improve the quality of those bi@@ ot@@ a and se@@ di@@ ments.

We live in an age where the volume of counterfe@@ it products is multi@@ pl@@ y@@ ing; we can see this taking place in the case of clothing it@@ em@@ s, with L@@ ac@@ ost@@ e, in the case of wat@@ ches, with Ro@@ lex@@ , and al@@ so, unfortun@@ ately, in the case of medicines.
We are just coming up to Al@@ pe d@@ ’@@ Hu@@ ez@@ , and I think you should bear in mind that the win@@ ner of the T@@ our gets to wear the only if he makes it through the whole distance and w@@ ins every stage.
We agree to the revision of the Commission's control over '@@ list@@ ings of substanc@@ es@@ ', '@@ withdrawal period@@ s' and '@@ principles and guidel@@ in@@ es'.
We all agree that scientific measures are nee@@ ded, methods to be used in abat@@ to@@ irs to remove the il@@ ia, the g@@ ang@@ li@@ a, the duoden@@ a, the ingu@@ in@@ al, medi@@ al, lat@@ er@@ al, ren@@ al, pre@@ fem@@ oral and cervical lymph no@@ d@@ es, but this is not the key issue.
There is a consen@@ sus that other substances bes@@ ides vitamins and minerals need to be subjected to scientific tests before they are covered by the directive.
We think that f@@ ant@@ as@@ y names should be allow@@ ed, especially for combined prepar@@ ations, provided no therapeutic effect is imp@@ lied or introduc@@ ed.
We take the view that unemployment - the most visible face of this crisis - does not simply mean a loss of income for those who are un@@ employed and their famili@@ es: unemployment discour@@ ages you and can lead to a loss of confidence in yourself and in those around you.
This is a total perversion of justic@@ e.
We are also entitled to receive meaningful answ@@ ers, and then to see changes in the negative pat@@ ter@@ n that can currently be observed.
We want to see that both the average life and the rate of consumption of products is dis@@ closed with the manufacture and use of the product.
We also all support the waste hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y where it is best to prev@@ ent, it is next best to re-@@ use and recycle@@ , and after that comes energy recovery.
This is a case of the pro@@ ver@@ b@@ ial o@@ str@@ ich with its head bu@@ ried in the s@@ and@@ ...

Many of us have seen document@@ ari@@ es, fil@@ ms and pic@@ tures showing dogs and cats having their fur removed even when they were still al@@ ive.
Many of us in the European Union are very gr@@ at@@ eful for the work of the Can@@ adi@@ ans, B@@ ant@@ ing and B@@ est, in dis@@ covering insulin some 75 years ago.
There is a feeling that many have in this Hou@@ se, that you are in office but you are not in control of the overall system.
In particular, we are concerned at the inadequate marg@@ in, 82 million under head@@ ing 1@@ A.
We have, for example, managed to ensure that consumers know the shel@@ f life of a product, by means of a small box containing a number which tell@@ s them how long a product can be used for.
We particularly support the view that labels on meat must include information on any potential embryo modifications or the animal@@ 's trans@@ genetic origin and information on the use of antibiotics and stimul@@ ants during feeding.
We are in favour of the use of boar@@ ding a@@ ids even for Cl@@ ass II vehicles, appropriate forms of hand@@ rail@@ s, entr@@ anc@@ es, lu@@ g@@ g@@ age rac@@ ks and special dest@@ ination displa@@ ys, in order to make the use of b@@ uses both possible and practical for disabled person@@ s.
We are concerned here with food that is within its expiry date, but is destroyed or removed from the market due to marketing regul@@ ations, over@@ ly strict European legislation and company image issu@@ es.
It is very good that the programme will not only include young people aged 15@@ -2@@ 5, but will be open to those aged 13@@ -@@ 30@@ .
We are often exposed to misleading adver@@ ti@@ se@@ ments claim@@ ing that the addition of a vitamin or another substance to a food product protec@@ ts consumers from cancer or other diseases of ‘@@ civil@@ isation@@ ’.
'@@ Ter@@ rib@@ ly sor@@ ry, you will not have any chance to reverse these laws after the next two elec@@ tions, ei@@ ther@@ '.
We still have a situation in which the brain from animals under 12 months old can be used.
There is the case of two Ukra@@ ini@@ an doctors who ris@@ ked their lives to expose local Ukra@@ ini@@ an businesses that market organ tissue from 20-@@ week@@ -@@ old bab@@ ies, purchas@@ ed, bir@@ th@@ ed and kept al@@ ive during the painful harvest@@ ing process.
We are all in the same bo@@ at@@ : if the bo@@ at sin@@ ks, no one will be sav@@ ed.
We are all quite happ@@ y to want safe food and safe chemic@@ als, but - and the Commission is dealing with this in the right way - this has to be done on a risk@@ -based system similar to that used for REAC@@ H@@ : if a chemical is safe to use then it can be used, but if it is not safe to use then it should be taken off the market.
We are all suffering from "@@ summ@@ iti@@ tis@@ "@@ , a condition in which wild@@ ly infl@@ ated expect@@ ations pu@@ ff up before each summit@@ .
We want Guideline No 22 to be del@@ et@@ ed.
We also make it clear that the employ@@ er is responsible for enforc@@ ing the we@@ aring of hearing protec@@ tors and the provision of individual training.
We agree with the establishment of a minimum training level, and consider it necessary that air@@ cre@@ ws should undergo periodic training whenever they are to transfer to a different type of aircraft (@@ this training being regarded as working time@@ ), to be concluded by appropriate testing for the renew@@ al or aw@@ ard of a new certific@@ ate.
We also support the highligh@@ ting of the mor@@ b@@ idity and mortality burden of health@@ -@@ care@@ -@@ associated infections and the need to recru@@ it more infection@@ -@@ control nur@@ ses.
We support the rapporteur@@ 's two amend@@ ments, one of which aims for a 2% decreas@@ e, and the other at an increase by the same amoun@@ t.
We will therefore support the aim of making maximum use of animals b@@ red for this purpose whose genetic and medical history are known, and who therefore offer greater consistency and compar@@ ability of data.
We are fed up with constant changes to the agenda and postpon@@ ements at short notic@@ e.
We are all in the same crisis caused by tur@@ b@@ oc@@ ap@@ it@@ alism.
It is urg@@ ed, therefore, that in future there should be an examination of technical necessity before the authorisation of addi@@ tives, and that there should be a further check some years later to see that the technical necessity actually still exists.
We are suggesting that where the rec@@ ital read@@ s ‘@@ the Nor@@ th-@@ West Fron@@ ti@@ er Pro@@ v@@ ince of Pakist@@ an, Afghanist@@ an, India and K@@ ash@@ mir@@ ’, it should now read@@ : ‘@@ in the region of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ , the Nor@@ th-@@ West Fron@@ ti@@ er Pro@@ v@@ ince of Pakist@@ an, Afghanist@@ an and Indi@@ a@@ ’.
We suggest a slight re@@ wording in line with standard termin@@ olog@@ y; that is: "@@ Where@@ as benz@@ ene is a human gen@@ otoxic carc@@ in@@ ogen and there is no identi@@ fi@@ able threshold below which there is no risk to human health@@ ;@@ "
We follow general principles and criteria as regards how much processing is necessary before the origin of a product is dec@@ ided.
When the public enter a ho@@ st@@ el@@ ry, restaur@@ ant or b@@ ar, where mixed drinks and many vari@@ eties of food are pre@@ pa@@ red, we work on the as@@ sumption that they know what is in them and can also find out by ask@@ ing.
This is, however, being wat@@ ched very closely because of the simil@@ arity between the immune system of pigs and of humans.
We also take it as read that you accep@@ t, in individual cases where there is hard evidence from Commission@@ er@@ s’ conduct in office of in@@ compati@@ bil@@ ities with their previous activi@@ ties, that you will have rec@@ our@@ se to this when Parliament requires it.
We would then treat this standard the same as other@@ s; it would not be mand@@ atory, but would bring certain advantages to the manufacturer@@ .
We are working together with the three level three committees on these tasks to deliver the requested results before the end of the year.
We are also working on other areas such as the hepatitis B and C virus@@ es, because we know they cause liver cancer, as well as aspects such as tobacc@@ o, obesity and other causes of cancer.
We fear for C@@ ô@@ te d'@@ I@@ vo@@ i@@ re, which is in danger of becoming further removed from the model for which it is so often ad@@ mi@@ red.
We therefore de@@ em it important to en@@ sh@@ rine once again the bio-@@ availability – meaning available to be used by the body – of vitamins and miner@@ als.
In the EU, we use thousands of tr@@ aps to catch animals that are not very highly rated among animal lo@@ ver@@ s: rats and water vol@@ es.
We use a lot of analysis and data provided by bodies such as the Council of Europe and the OS@@ CE@@ , as well as agencies and other think@@ -@@ tank@@ s.
We will ensure that you do, you can be sure of that!

We want young Pol@@ es, young Hung@@ ari@@ ans, young Cz@@ ech@@ s, young Slovak@@ s, young Romani@@ ans, Eston@@ i@@ ans, Latvi@@ ans and Lithu@@ ani@@ ans.
We all want to significantly reduce the quantities used and the toxicity of the various ingredients in deter@@ g@@ ents.
We also need information about when the substitutes which the industry may introduce will be open to equivalent testing.
We want to be sure that those treating us are able to act effectively and effici@@ ently, which we cannot be when we have research showing that 24 hours of sustained wa@@ k@@ eful@@ ness reduces performance to levels associated with excessive alcohol intake without - I would arg@@ ue - some of the pleas@@ ures.

B@@ es@@ ides class@@ m@@ ates and gam@@ es, they use '@@ unknown us@@ er@@ ' networks via ch@@ at rooms on web@@ sit@@ es, which are perfect contact points for pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es using false identi@@ ties to l@@ ure potential victim@@ s.
B@@ es@@ ides the differences in the success rates of treat@@ ments, we also have significant differences in the frequ@@ ency, or scop@@ e, of early cancer detec@@ tion, differences in pal@@ li@@ ative care and differences in the effectiveness of re@@ h@@ abil@@ itation of cancer patients.
In addition to the gender disp@@ ar@@ ities in health care and the need for a gen@@ der@@ -@@ specific approach to health complain@@ ts, as indicated in the report, there are many areas left where women and health have a special relationship and where gen@@ der@@ -@@ specific effects can therefore be anticip@@ ated.
In addition to the soci@@ o-@@ economic and lifestyle factors the genotype is an important risk factor in breast cancer.
Pos@@ sible explan@@ ations, in addition to shortcom@@ ings in the implementation of the feed ban@@ , are introduction of the removal of specified risk materials in Spain only at the end of 2000 and a higher than average exposure to infected meat and bone meal in the 199@@ 6-@@ 1998 period.

Many people may also be un@@ awa@@ re, or choose not to know, that the F@@ AR@@ C, EL@@ N and AUC are organisations which appear on the European Union@@ ’s list of terrorist organis@@ ations.
Furthermore, although it is rare for human beings to be infec@@ ted, there have nonethel@@ ess been out@@ breaks among the human population in recent years caused by certain avi@@ an-@@ influenza virus@@ es, leading to doz@@ ens of fat@@ alities in Asi@@ a.
Moreover, some den@@ omin@@ ations seen as dis@@ sid@@ ent by the regi@@ me, such as the Un@@ ified Bud@@ d@@ h@@ ist Ch@@ ur@@ ch of Viet@@ nam@@ , and some Ho@@ a Ha@@ o and Ca@@ o D@@ ai groups, remain illegal and face continued har@@ ass@@ ment.
Furthermore, there are chur@@ ches which do not address the issues of contraception to their con@@ g@@ reg@@ ation.
Moreover, some excessively general as@@ ser@@ tions such as ‘@@ health@@ y@@ ’ or ‘@@ good for you@@ ’ have absolutely no scientific found@@ ation and may even dec@@ e@@ ive the bu@@ y@@ er.
Moreover, these ban@@ an@@ as are produced in E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or by 10-@@ year-old children who are paid USD 2 a day, who inhal@@ e pestic@@ ides, who have asth@@ ma, who have problems with their balance and who suffer from cere@@ b@@ ell@@ ar at@@ ax@@ ia.

Nor will the risk of overdose disappear with this directive.
Furthermore, breast cancer often occurs amongst child@@ less women, or amongst women who become pregnant relatively late in life and who go through the men@@ op@@ ause relatively l@@ ate.
Moreover, this greater reduction is also necessary because it takes more account of the switch from a temporary AD@@ I to a lower permanent AD@@ I adopted by the Scientific Committe@@ e.

At the same time, however, extremely serious events have taken place in the Phil@@ ip@@ p@@ ines in recent days@@ : 57 people in a con@@ vo@@ y in support of a presid@@ ential candi@@ date were massac@@ red by an armed group, which explo@@ ited the revolu@@ tionary situation to take up arms against the govern@@ ment, to the point that mar@@ tial law has been declared in the Phil@@ ip@@ p@@ ines.
In addition, regular inspections must be made.

However, the at-@@ risk-@@ of-@@ poverty rate for those in employment was 8% on average in 2008 - the so-called '@@ working poor@@ '.
Furthermore, as regards the possible addition of sugar to fruit ju@@ ice, there is cause for surpris@@ e that no limit value is stated in the proposal.
In addition, due to the qu@@ ir@@ ks of Hungarian regulations and in con@@ trav@@ en@@ tion of the right of '@@ hab@@ e@@ as cor@@ p@@ us@@ ', the j@@ udge who keep@@ s extending the pre-@@ trial detention does not take a close look at the in@@ crimin@@ ating evidence against them.
Moreover, proper account should be taken of the specific situations and potential difficulties of the benefici@@ ary countries.
Furthermore, the deterioration of drug ad@@ dict@@ s' health is of concern@@ , but also the health risks ar@@ ising from infection such as HIV, tubercul@@ osis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, as well as the increasing number of deaths from over@@ doses and poison@@ ing.
On the other hand it is obvious that eating farm@@ ed salmon is less healthy than eating wild salmon@@ .
I also consider it important that Euro@@ j@@ ust@@ 's involvement in investigations and pro@@ secu@@ tions should not be ham@@ pe@@ red by unnecessary bureaucracy.
In addition, it is important for m@@ aps to be drawn up which indicate the areas in the vic@@ inity of an establishment that could be affected after a major accident.
Moreover, setting abortion up as a new method of contraception is out of the question.
Furthermore, it is also necessary to control the use of antibiotics by general practition@@ ers in hospit@@ als, because we all know that the total quantity of antibiotics used in human medications is far greater than the quantity of antibiotics used as additives in animal food.
It is also prac@@ tically impossible from a technical point of view, given the mar@@ sh area that it has to cros@@ s.
Furthermore, it is very important for the UN@@ H@@ R@@ C to be better equipped to address both chronic and emergency situ@@ ations, perhaps through the expan@@ sion of the human rights to@@ ol@@ bo@@ x, by using pan@@ els not just during but also in-@@ between session@@ s.
Moreover, there is a similar threat in Slovakia from the re@@ opening of several old min@@ es for preci@@ ous metal@@ s, where the use of cyanide technology is under consideration due to the low concentrations of the preci@@ ous metal@@ s.
In addition, it ought to be pointed out that the level of reserv@@ es needed should increase according to how far an economy open@@ s up to others. The more an economy open@@ s up, the greater the risks and the higher the level of reserv@@ es needed.
B@@ es@@ ides, medication cannot be distributed like s@@ acks of ric@@ e.
In point of fact, it is not negotiating with the terrorist@@ s, but with the resist@@ ance, including it in the reconstruction process.
Moreover, it is not always possible to determine in advance to what use such equipment will be put@@ .
Furthermore, there is no proven link between the promotion of such ‘@@ reproductive righ@@ t@@ s’ and a fall in the number of those infected with A@@ ids.
Another specific example was that of special advis@@ ers for the Committee of the Reg@@ ions.
However, irrespective of the G@@ old@@ stone report, there is currently no reason to continue the si@@ eg@@ e on Gaz@@ a.
I also share the analysis that the Council is rather weaker than had been hop@@ ed.
And I was del@@ igh@@ ted to dis@@ co@@ ver, during the course of discussions with the in@@ surance companies, that they are now working from mortality tab@@ les that go up not to 80, but to 120 years.
I also welcome the decision to also include drinking y@@ og@@ hur@@ t and milk@@ -based bever@@ ages in the regulation.
I can also fully agree that these substitution plans should be key factors in the decision to grant authorisations and in any further revision of such author@@ is@@ ations.
Moreover, the increase in life expectancy also makes it more likely that diseases such as Alzheimer's will become more common.
Furthermore, the Commission should evaluate the results of the first macro@@ -@@ regional strategies implemented.
The Commission should also be more circum@@ spec@@ t in deleg@@ ating to third parties tasks that should be performed by a public service body.
The Commission is also involved in the working party set up to implement the framework for action set out in D@@ ak@@ ar.

Furthermore, the duration of the programme has been reduced to three years, although it was set at five years in the original proposal.
Furthermore, training of police offic@@ ers and provision of the necessary equipment have continued.
Also, the training of cl@@ erg@@ y must re@@ su@@ me.
Moreover, the possibility of cho@@ osing a ty@@ re according to its specific performance is another tool enab@@ ling consumers to protect themselves and equ@@ i@@ p their vehicles in a manner appropriate to their style of driving and the environmental conditions where they dri@@ ve.
Sec@@ on@@ d, the presentation of the E@@ IT has been established on a pil@@ ot@@ -@@ phase basis.
The process of the motion has also been adversely affected by these circumstances.
Furthermore, the proposal sets a strict limit for chro@@ mium -@@ 6 in c@@ ement, as chro@@ mium -@@ 6 has been shown to induce disab@@ ling and allergic eczema, especially among c@@ ement work@@ ers.
Furthermore, the question of contamination is dependent on what measures are taken to ensure that other areas are not contaminated during release experim@@ ents.
Furthermore, the reduction in quot@@ as should begin with sur@@ plus quantities and those intended for expor@@ t, which do most damage to the international market in this product.
In addition, reducing subsidies for some treatments means that patients are unable to continue with the treatment, entail@@ ing a much he@@ avi@@ er price and consequences for their health.
Furthermore, the dr@@ y@@ ness of the ground in summer makes it prac@@ tically impossible to pull up the plant together with its ro@@ ots in order to obtain long fi@@ bre@@ .
Moreover, there are over 10 000 empty d@@ well@@ ings, which are not ca@@ red for and which are falling down.
In addition, on 9 October 2007 Portugal submitted a request for mobil@@ isation of the Fun@@ d for 1 5@@ 46 redund@@ anc@@ ies in the autom@@ ob@@ ile sector@@ , specifically for workers made redund@@ ant by O@@ pe@@ l in Az@@ am@@ bu@@ j@@ a, Alco@@ a F@@ u@@ j@@ ik@@ ura in Se@@ ix@@ al and Johnson Contro@@ ls in Por@@ tal@@ e@@ gre@@ .
In addition, breast cancer can be trig@@ ge@@ red by complications following abor@@ tion.
In addition, the Scientific Committee of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency met in London on 15 and 16 A@@ pr@@ il.
Also, debate does not always convinc@@ e.
Moreover, the dead@@ line is fixed for the Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day of the week before the week when the question will be discus@@ sed, but given that the questions are discussed on Tues@@ days that makes eight working days, in which case the time period is exceeded however you interpre@@ t it.
In addition, the disposal of the treated se@@ wage sl@@ udge in the san@@ itary landfill site at A@@ no Li@@ osi@@ a is considered to be a factor which will lead to the s@@ atur@@ ation of the site.
In addition the task force has defined a set of methods to be developed and valid@@ at@@ ed: a comparison of sensitiv@@ ity, relevance and reli@@ ability of the tests for testing the effects of endocrine disrup@@ ters on human health and/or the environment.
There is also the formulation on reimbur@@ sement in case of delay (at least 2 hours, with half of the tic@@ ket price to be reimbur@@ sed - compare rail transport with reimbur@@ sement from 1 hour@@ 's delay@@ ).
Moreover, EM@@ SA has recently concluded contracts with other oil recovery vessels in order to provide Europe's coast@@ s with even better protec@@ tion, and, in the very near future, two new vess@@ els, the Ba@@ hia U@@ no and the Ba@@ hia Tre@@ s, will be operating out of Al@@ g@@ ec@@ ir@@ as Ba@@ y.

The report also places li@@ ability for vaccines with manufacturer@@ s, which may hin@@ der the supply of vaccines and blur@@ s lines of accoun@@ tab@@ ility.
In addition, in the event of the N@@ PT being ero@@ ded, a negative effect is to be expec@@ ted, similar to that in respect of the biological and chemical weap@@ ons.
The same is also true of coun@@ ting the slaughter of the animal as reduction of milk production.
Furthermore, the addi@@ tions requested to cod@@ es 70 and 71 concerning the indication of the symbol of the third country in accordance with the harmon@@ ized E@@ EC@@ /@@ UN list would make for a better understanding in cases where a holder is ex@@ changing a driving lic@@ ence obtained in a third country.
Furthermore, national authorities should exam@@ ine ways of improving their servic@@ es, and attention needs to be paid to improving early detection so that victims can be informed early that they have Alzheimer's and decide if they wish to be ca@@ red for at home or placed in resid@@ ential care before acute dementia sets in.
In addition, the following changes have been request@@ ed:
In addition, the hol@@ dings have to be placed under the effective control of the Braz@@ ili@@ an veterinary services and regularly inspec@@ ted by the Braz@@ ili@@ an authorities.
Nor are women given the same access as men to health care and to medicines that ret@@ ard the progress of the disease.

Moreover, the individual govern@@ ments should introduce national breast@@ -@@ screening programmes in all the Member States, because early detection of breast cancer can significantly reduce mortality rates.
Furthermore, consumer hab@@ its acquired in youth can also affect health and set long@@ er@@ -term consumption pattern@@ s, which means that we must not only give a commit@@ ment to health promo@@ tion, education and information polici@@ es, but also to measures limiting alcohol consumption by children and adolescents and structural actions in the field of treating young people and helping them to better adap@@ t to soci@@ ety.
The website also contains the new standard form for making a complain@@ t.

Furthermore, organisations who continue to treat women as inf@@ eri@@ or workers should be nam@@ ed and sha@@ med.
In addition, per@@ secu@@ tions on political and/or the@@ ological grounds continue to occur frequ@@ ently.
Furthermore, opportunities for the intensi@@ fication and ver@@ tic@@ alisation of production can present major risks for human and animal health, which must be monitored so as to prevent any type of '@@ ma@@ d co@@ w diseas@@ e' for fish.
Moreover, regulations can be a constrain@@ t which varies according to the State in question, as is, no@@ tab@@ ly, the case with regard to gra@@ in storage, in respect of the imper@@ me@@ ability of the groun@@ d, the water sampl@@ ing limit@@ s, which are set at 5% of the low water discharge in France and 30% in Germany and waste disposal monitor@@ ing.
Furthermore, salmon are continu@@ ally switching from salt water to fresh water, and from fresh water to salt water.
B@@ ack@@ ward facing child seats will also be for@@ bid@@ den unless the air@@ bag is disabled and passengers will have to wear bel@@ ts in every vehicle fitted with them.

There is also the risk of the real criminals adap@@ ting to the profile by using inno@@ cent@@ -@@ looking people as drug mul@@ es or suicide bomb@@ ers or by changing travel routes away from those monitored.
A high birth rate combined with a high mortality rate makes for a mostly young Rom@@ a population. 80% are younger than 34@@ , whilst 4@@ 3% are under 14 years.

Furthermore, the European Union must be aware - as indeed it is - that by 20@@ 25, 30% of its population will be over 65 years of age.
If you notic@@ e, both in the distance relationship between message and television vie@@ wer and especially in the division of ro@@ les in the commerci@@ als, it is always the man who comes across as in@@ compe@@ t@@ ent, represented as le@@ tting himself be ens@@ na@@ red in the da@@ zz@@ ling tra@@ p of some portion of the female epider@@ mis@@ , always shown art@@ ful@@ ly, tru@@ e, but also sometimes with grac@@ e, and that needs to be stated cal@@ ml@@ y.

Under the gu@@ ise of the sexual liber@@ ation of 19@@ 68 on@@ wards the tri@@ vi@@ alization of sex@@ u@@ ality, which has reduced sex to an immediate consumer objec@@ t, ex@@ pos@@ es many young women and girls to problems which compromise a full and lasting life as part of a cou@@ ple@@ .
After all, on what criteria should such a list be bas@@ ed?
Also, by the time the Commission got around to producing the communic@@ ation, it was being bom@@ bar@@ ded with no@@ tific@@ ations from Member States that they would begin to use the opt-@@ out in their health@@ -@@ care sectors in response to the SI@@ MA@@ P and J@@ a@@ eg@@ er rul@@ ings.

In addition to these easily visible situ@@ ations, it is as@@ sumed that there are also many cases of production dec@@ entr@@ alis@@ ation, out@@ sourc@@ ing or sub@@ contr@@ acting which, in a less direc@@ t, less visible way, can lead to un@@ declared work.
Al@@ ongside them there are the so-called individual systems, operating on a regional basis or limited to particular chains of super@@ market@@ s, but, as these do not constitute a self-@@ sufficient whole, their effect is to wh@@ ol@@ ly frag@@ ment the can deposit system.
This should be accompanied by development of management information and accounting systems, which would enable the Commission to exercise proper supervision to detect errors and cases of mis@@ administration promp@@ tly.

Al@@ ongside proposals for mam@@ m@@ ography screening for women aged 50-@@ 69@@ , for faec@@ al oc@@ cul@@ t blood testing of people aged 50-@@ 74 and for cervical s@@ me@@ ars for women aged 20-@@ 30, other urgent actions are needed.

Simp@@ ly because the military has that forc@@ e, it cannot and must not, except in times of emerg@@ ency, have the power of decision on the use of forc@@ e.

Because there is a '@@ broad consen@@ sus@@ ' in every country on what the Treaty propos@@ es, especially in the national parliam@@ ents.
Because it is not enough simply to expose the responsibil@@ ities and disast@@ rous sl@@ ack@@ ness of the Commission - they must be pen@@ aliz@@ ed.
Because the extremely powerful and weal@@ thy organisation called The National R@@ if@@ le Association - the N@@ RA - helped to elec@@ t the present administration, which will therefore not stand up to the Associ@@ ation.
It is taking place because a transitional period has just come to an end in Spain and Portug@@ al.
These key consider@@ ations define the most important premis@@ ses for the further development of stat@@ ut@@ ory frame@@ works.
This means that Europe is paying to have more deser@@ t!
The resolution also calls for the transfer of data to be authorised only when the system is fully operative and for operation of the system to be adequately monitored.
Th@@ rough this vot@@ e, the European Parliament is deliver@@ ing a genuine message of hope to all patients (@@ diab@@ e@@ tics, those suffering from Parkinson@@ ’s and Alzheimer@@ ’s diseases and people with chronic heart failure and other diseas@@ es).
F@@ ort@@ un@@ ately, this time it was possible to aver@@ t a traged@@ y.
I will not waste your time by discus@@ sing these amend@@ ments, which are certainly out of touch and back@@ war@@ d-@@ looking and absur@@ d in every way.
Do@@ ñ@@ ana National Park
In compar@@ is@@ on, given the amounts at stak@@ e, we cannot but be taken ab@@ ack by the lack of aid which was available following the devast@@ ation w@@ re@@ aked on French forest@@ s by the storm@@ s, the effects of the flo@@ ods in P@@ ic@@ ard@@ y and the immediate damage caused by the E@@ ri@@ k@@ a.
This com@@ pa@@ res with 300 million in the United States and thus represents an economy of the same order of magnit@@ u@@ de.
The price varies from N@@ L@@ G 30 000 to N@@ L@@ G 4@@ 50.
Consequently, 20% of port@@ able nick@@ el@@ -@@ cadmium batter@@ ies end up as landfill or in an inciner@@ ator.
So, in order to address enormous new challeng@@ es, the EU once again needs two European stat@@ es@@ men in the Aden@@ au@@ er, Sch@@ um@@ an or De G@@ asper@@ i m@@ oul@@ d.
As a result, not enough active substances will be available in future to combat pe@@ sts properly.
Therefore, in future, any advertising of the price or energy efficiency of refriger@@ ator@@ s, wash@@ ing machines or co@@ ok@@ ers must indicate the product@@ 's energy cl@@ as@@ s.
Over the longer term, therefore, the use of P@@ FO@@ S will only be permitted where its replacement is im@@ possible, and where it does not come into direct contact with the human body.
So an end to hypocris@@ y!
As a result, every advance that we have made in the European process has had no one colour and has come from no one country or ide@@ ology. It has had no one colour@@ , no one ide@@ ological colour@@ , and no one flag@@ .
No legislative procedure is therefore required.
In@@ stead of a reduction in the mean@@ s, this will now lead to an increase, which is a little bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re, to say the least@@ .
As a result, on one p@@ age, in Article 7@@ 5, Parliament is a co@@ legis@@ lat@@ or and, on another p@@ age, in Article 2@@ 15, Parliament only has to be informed about events.
Therefore, until a decision is form@@ ally taken, there is no room for legal action.
Consequently, despite the risk of dissemination varying according to the type of genetically modified crop@@ , their management cannot be effici@@ ently and vi@@ ably contain@@ ed.
Consequently, while we will continue to observe closely the whole set of events with a view, if necessary, to pursu@@ ing cases related to neglig@@ ence, there is no evidence that would justify that course of action at this junc@@ ture.
Thus, this conflict which has been sm@@ oul@@ dering for several dec@@ ades could enter into a decis@@ ive phase and produce un@@ expected ge@@ o-@@ political changes.
Therefore, the discussion is not about '@@ whe@@ ther@@ ', but '@@ ho@@ w@@ ' it can be effec@@ ted.
It ought not, therefore, to be immediately interpre@@ ted as a b@@ an.
This mechanism therefore has to be very welcom@@ e.
It is, then, not only stud@@ ents and reti@@ red people tempor@@ arily resid@@ ent, or working in, another country, but also people travelling who will no doubt make more use of the new Health In@@ surance Car@@ d, for they will no longer have to contact the social authorities but will have the card and be able to go directly to the doctor@@ ’@@ s.
Therefore, this needs consideration.
As a result, the scheme needs to be set up in such a way that schools are provided only with healthy fruit containing pesticide levels well below the maximum allow@@ able limit@@ s.
Therefore, amounts which are not implemented in future years can very easily be canc@@ el@@ led.
As a result, they pay lower tax@@ es, need not comply with many rules and can h@@ ire cre@@ ws at develop@@ ing-@@ world sal@@ ari@@ es.
These cases therefore need to be examined with particular care.
These cases keep occur@@ ring.
Both types of trans@@ -f@@ at@@ ty acid are in fact equally harmful if too much is con@@ su@@ med.
The sector therefore needs the continued support of the public authorities if it is to develop in a controlled manner without growth for some leading to bank@@ rup@@ t@@ c@@ y for others.
Therefore, these children are not elig@@ ible for adop@@ tion.
Consequently, these quantities are going to hin@@ der development in the European Union with regard to short@@ - and long-@@ fibr@@ e fla@@ x and h@@ emp@@ .
These signat@@ ures therefore constitute a pro@@ test.
These sensitive areas must therefore be sensi@@ tive.
The work is therefore financ@@ ially under@@ valued and is often not considered to be normal employment under labour la@@ w, as a result of which workers are exposed to un@@ authorised and un@@ fair treatment.
Accor@@ ding@@ ly, it does not belong to the part which should be public@@ iz@@ ed. It is part of the investig@@ ation.
Therefore, this un@@ ified approach is un@@ justi@@ fied.
This category must also be clearly defined and taken into account in the statis@@ tics.
Therefore, this step by the European Union is welcom@@ ed as a good example to other third countries.
The new Council therefore represents clear progress compared to the UN@@ H@@ CH@@ R.
Such a sentence should therefore only be imposed in exceptional circumstances.
Therefore, this common position is a good first step.
H@@ ence each individual sha@@ re@@ holder has to be accepted as one farm@@ er.
Therefore, it, like other sign@@ atory countries, must not only observe its spir@@ it, but follow it to the let@@ ter.
So, as the United Kingdom will have the best of both worl@@ ds, I ab@@ st@@ ain.
Ho@@ w, therefore, can it be that Spain could cont@@ em@@ plate extr@@ ad@@ iting another EU nation@@ al?
How will it then be possible to carry out effective checks of paren@@ tal author@@ ity?
Therefore, in accordance with Ru@@ le 12@@ 3, it will be forwar@@ ded to its addres@@ se@@ es and published in the T@@ ex@@ ts Ad@@ op@@ ted of this sit@@ ting, together with the names of the sign@@ ator@@ ies.
H@@ ence, in accordance with the E@@ SA regul@@ ations, the chair@@ person of each E@@ SA is appointed by the board of supervis@@ ors.
Consequ@@ ent@@ ly:
As a result, Copenhagen was considered a failure and C@@ anc@@ ú@@ n was viewed as progress.
In some cases, therefore, the intention is that, if resid@@ ence is changed, the advantages of one country be replaced by the advantages of another.
Thus, in situations where more flexible instruments or arrangements are in place between Member States, those should pre@@ va@@ il over this Fra@@ me@@ work Decision provided that they do not lower the protection aff@@ or@@ ded to the suspected or accused pers@@ on.
So in the case of Do@@ ñ@@ an@@ a, just as with any other complain@@ t lo@@ dg@@ ed under Community procedure, the Commission can never arch@@ ive it un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally.
As a result, in the frame@@ work@@ -@@ programme, this is clearly completely excluded at the mom@@ ent.
Consequently, according to the data coll@@ ated and evaluated by the Treatment Cent@@ re, this category of users is almost non-@@ exist@@ ent.
There is therefore a risk that many employ@@ ers will simply not h@@ ire young women.
As a consequ@@ ence, under your cap@@ tain@@ c@@ y, our h@@ ull is pressed deep into the water@@ line under the accumul@@ ated weight of your deb@@ t.
As a result, millions of vehicles are transpor@@ ting fre@@ ight every day, from private cars to H@@ G@@ V@@ s, and the adverse effects such as congestion, no@@ ise, environmental pollution and fine dust pollution are escal@@ ating.
Consequently, the method has not been scientific@@ ally perfec@@ ted, its medium and long-term results are unknown, and there has been no investigation of all the possible consequences for the organ@@ ism of the cloned anim@@ al.
Therefore, from a strictly legal point of view, the establishment of a permanent exception should be ruled out fore@@ ver.
It is therefore essential that it protect these forest@@ s and preci@@ ous reg@@ ions.
Consequently, it cannot support the amendment that would remove the derog@@ ation for small magnes@@ ium d@@ ye@@ -@@ cast@@ ers using less than 500 kg per an@@ num@@ .
Consequently, it cannot always maintain the cru@@ ising speed set at a particular time.
It therefore me@@ ets the criteria for list@@ ing in CI@@ TE@@ S Ap@@ pen@@ di@@ x I.
Therefore, by exactly defin@@ ing the areas with natural han@@ dic@@ ap@@ s, it will be possible to obtain sufficient funds to make use of the land and improve agricultural out@@ put@@ .
Thus, in June 200@@ 3, the interest rate on the main re@@ financing operations reached 2@@ %.
Consequently, in ag@@ ri@@ -@@ mon@@ etary mat@@ ters, the difficulties that have aris@@ en as a result of changes in exchange rates, and which have had ag@@ ri@@ -@@ mon@@ etary reperc@@ us@@ sions, will disappear.
Consequently, s@@ ending a significant military force with operational capacity to sou@@ thern Le@@ ban@@ on is a solution that could change the course of events and that could help prevent a repe@@ ti@@ tion of the attacks and the war@@ s.
Therefore, given the value of the radio spectr@@ um, it is imper@@ ative to set out the EU's priorities for its alloc@@ ation and use.
So let us nail that particular argum@@ ent.
So it is as you pleas@@ e: either now or at 9 p.m.
As a result it has faced enormous internal pressure and threat@@ ened inst@@ ability.
Therefore, standardisation should be clearly defin@@ ed.
F@@ eas@@ ible solutions should therefore be pursu@@ ed in a pr@@ ag@@ m@@ atic manner.
For this reason we need to follow the recommendations of the RO@@ ME@@ -@@ PE study.
Accor@@ ding@@ ly, it is fit@@ ting that the passing of such a spor@@ ting col@@ os@@ sus should be noted in this international parliam@@ ent.
Therefore, it must be ad@@ missible to move this plen@@ ary week in Strasbourg from week 10 to week 11.
C@@ lear@@ ly, there has been a mis@@ understand@@ ing.
I therefore fear that the situation will deterior@@ ate into to@@ k@@ en@@ ism, especially if the authorization procedure is to rely solely on information provided by produc@@ ers.
These dead@@ lines for submission must therefore be stag@@ ge@@ red accordingly.
It is therefore right that the report should take into account features such as short breaks or the use of the Internet to book tri@@ ps.
It is therefore correct that Amendment No@@  @@ 20@@ 6 should fall@@ .
This is essentially due to problems with the contract@@ or. It is therefore impossible to begin implementing the new computer@@ ized transi@@ t system in 1998.
As a result, it is hard to see the time@@ fr@@ ame for a full region@@ -to-@@ region agreement as less than three to four years, and it is difficult to see us achieving a consistent high level of ambi@@ tion.
Consequently, it is advisable to set all initiatives at European level on the e-@@ Europe test ben@@ ch. In other word@@ s@@ ...
Therefore, the key is to get prior@@ iti@@ s@@ ation, to make the system work@@ able, to protect health, to reduce the number of animal tests and to achieve it all in ten years.
Therefore, it is essential that a decision on the location of the E@@ IT be made quickly.
Consequently, it is vital that a limit value should be set to limit the damage.
This means that those who make their living from legal produce are doub@@ ly pen@@ aliz@@ ed, because their ear@@ ning ability is reduced.
It is therefore important to respect prescribed principles and standard@@ s.
Therefore, it is important that within a flo@@ od pl@@ ain area the down@@ stream countries be involved as well in the tasks of prevention and def@@ ence.
Therefore, it is important that the EU gives support to clear and re@@ structure old plant@@ ations.
It is therefore necessary to shor@@ ten these excessively long time period@@ s.
One is therefore entitled to ask more questions about the reperc@@ ussions of direct investment projects than one would about the problems associated with trade and comm@@ erc@@ e.
So it is time the negotiations were suspen@@ ded.
Consequently, it is time for firm European action.
Therefore, it is val@@ id.
Therefore, national milk quot@@ as should be increased to enable lower milk prices to be achieved within the internal market as well as to allow the possibility of export@@ ing more milk to third countries.
Consequently, the bul@@ k of the action must be taken before@@ hand.
As a result, the directive must make this distinc@@ tion.
It is therefore essential to ensure that the public is made awa@@ re.
Me@@ an@@ ing that we need a new approach@@ , with a more European dimen@@ sion.
Therefore, it is important to keep these costs to a minim@@ um.
Consequently, the set dates for the start and the end of sum@@ mer@@ time are to be welcom@@ ed.
It is not for the Council to com@@ ment.
Thus there is no need to respond to them.
The focus should therefore not be on the borderline cases, the thir@@ teen and thir@@ ty-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds, who might perhaps be able to take part under special circumstances, but shoul@@ d, as be@@ fore, be on the core group of those aged between 15 and 18@@ .
Therefore, compar@@ is@@ ons must not be made of Belar@@ us, which is controlled by a clear, transparent and one might say clinical example of a regi@@ me, with Ukra@@ ine, which is strug@@ gl@@ ing with the problems of democr@@ atis@@ ation.
The importance of supporting treatment programmes by producing quality antiretroviral drugs at low prices can@@ not, therefore, be ov@@ e@@ restim@@ ated.
Consequently, there can be no development without peac@@ e.
This is not therefore the result, as we would sometimes like to believ@@ e, of ca@@ rel@@ ess@@ ness in local development.
Therefore, it will not be possible to take the floor under the cat@@ ch-@@ the-@@ eye procedure.
That means that it will not be possible to make a full assessment of the new system until that time.
There is therefore no point in Braz@@ il stopping mi@@ re@@ x production if Ar@@ gent@@ ina does not follow suit@@ ; simil@@ arly, there is no reason for the EU to ban D@@ D@@ T if China continues to produce it and use it.
There is no ag@@ ency, therefore, that is not subject to the Cour@@ t's controls.
There is no risk therefore of there being any difficulty between the Council and the Commission in terms of achieving the objective of giving more advantages to developing countries so that they can export to Union market@@ s.
Consequently, there is no single system.
Thus, there is no acute risk@@ ; it is a matter of precau@@ tion.
There is therefore no reason for Member States such as Germany and France to lif@@ t their de fac@@ to mor@@ ator@@ ia.
Consequ@@ ently there are no direct European Union support systems for wool and no common organ@@ ization of the market.
They are therefore difficult to implement and to control.
On that basis, it is for them to decide whether all the safety conditions are met.
Therefore, they should be used spar@@ ingly and prud@@ ently, but there are occas@@ ions when they must be used decis@@ iv@@ ely.
As a result it will be possible to market milk with any fat content, provided that this is marked clearly on the packaging.
Consequently, they do not link into a cross-border point ei@@ ther.
Consequently, they are, and must continue to be, bound to these constitu@@ encies.
I therefore have a question for the Council@@ : are you aware of these possible reserv@@ ations, and what will you do to avoid any problems associated with the non-@@ accession of Li@@ ech@@ ten@@ ste@@ in?
I therefore voted for the use of the term '@@ inc@@ it@@ ement@@ ' rather than '@@ provoc@@ ation@@ ', since this is more accurate and gives less le@@ e@@ way.
I nevertheless think that the less med@@ d@@ ling there is by the Commission and the bureauc@@ rats in the automatic evaluation of dipl@@ omas the better it will be for the freedom of movement of citizen@@ s.
So, as far as I am concerned, the Commission - we can always critic@@ ize it, it is used to being a sort of scapego@@ at - has done its duty by stres@@ sing to Member States which support the DNA criteria - the broad@@ est criteria - that labelling must be clear, that progress must be made rapid@@ ly, and that even if there is only a trace of the product, it should be mentioned.
I therefore request that this be orally amended to "@@ bi@@ en@@ ni@@ al@@ " .
I therefore welcome this new legislation since it@@ : increases the number of sur@@ fact@@ ants that will be monitored and measure@@ d; it introduc@@ es a new technique for measuring bio@@ degrad@@ abil@@ ity@@ ; it harmon@@ ises risk assessment systems and promotes a new labelling system.
I do not at all agre@@ e, therefore – this was another of Mr @@ van@@  @@ den@@  @@ B@@ erg@@ ’s more cutting re@@ marks – that this is a conserv@@ ative approach and scheme.
I therefore have no idea as to the source of the data differenti@@ ating between the B@@ ay of Bis@@ ca@@ y and else@@ where with regard to the situation or the reduction in stoc@@ k.
Therefore, I believe the procedures for developing such projects should be regulated in a more strict and clear@@ -@@ cut way.
Consequently, I do not think that the two causes should be conf@@ used.
Consequently, I consider that an association with a monopol@@ y is not a good associ@@ ation, as a good association should be as un@@ f@@ et@@ tered as possible.
Therefore I propose under Ru@@ le 15@@ 5 to add '@@ [@@ 18 months after the date of public@@ ation@@ ]@@ ' as the date for transp@@ osi@@ tion.
However I think it would be difficult for a dipl@@ oma to have any intr@@ insi@@ c value and that it should never be a substitute for the work experience which the holder has gain@@ ed.
Therefore, access to such a service should be regulated by the Treaty and by this directive.
Consequently, the agreement has been suspen@@ ded, and no data is being transfer@@ red.
Therefore, the immediate cessation of the development, production and storage of nuclear arms is necessary.
Therefore, the Commission ensu@@ res the trans@@ lation in as many languages as possible of those websites or website sections which are of interest to all citizen@@ s, whereas more technical subjects, which are of interest to special@@ ists, are available either in a limited number of languages or in their original language only.
Therefore the Commission believ@@ es that prior st@@ un@@ ning should always be performed when pigs or lam@@ bs are slaughtered outside slaugh@@ ter@@ hous@@ es.
The Commission, therefore, does not consider it justifi@@ able to proceed with a further re-@@ evaluation of this sweet@@ en@@ er or to alter its labelling rul@@ es.
Consequ@@ ently the Commission returned to its previous practice.
In consequ@@ ence, the European Commission should not demand its re@@ pay@@ ment.
The Commission, therefore, has never proposed this sweet@@ en@@ er for author@@ isation.
So, should the Commission not present proposals now for revis@@ ing REACH and perhaps also other types of legislation in order to stipul@@ ate that cock@@ tail effects must be taken into account in the authorisation process on the basis of the substitution principle@@ ?
That is why the Commission cannot support proposals which amount to wat@@ ering down the goal of concentr@@ ation.
As a result, it would not be an exagg@@ eration if the Commission were still to be por@@ tra@@ yed as the guar@@ di@@ an of procedures.
And will the Commission be taking measures so that the aid plan can lead to full eradic@@ ation?
Therefore the conclusion has to be that the opt-@@ out must stay and ab@@ us@@ es, if an@@ y, must go.
The date of the Commission's conver@@ gence report therefore depend@@ s, on the one hand, on when the Member State presents the request and, on the other, on when the Commission can be provided with the appropriate, rigorous and accurate data required in order to carry out the assessment.
Accor@@ ding@@ ly, the final decision on the cont@@ ing@@ ency reserve must be left until the autum@@ n.
The Enter@@ pris@@ e DG has a responsibil@@ ity, therefore, to ensure that the EC@@ PA@@ T project continues to receive support from another DG before the support in its present form is withdrawn.
Consequently, when the Commission produces the amended version of Directive 90@@ /2@@ 20, it must be sure to include clear indications on risk assessment.
The proposed directive therefore elimin@@ ates the exceptions which appeared in the original directive, since they were conce@@ ived of in different circumstances and allowed the use of adult safety bel@@ ts in the absence of a child restrain@@ t system.
Therefore, the distribution of free fruit and veget@@ ables in schools could make a large difference to children's eating habit@@ s.
Therefore, given that here the form is ad substanti@@ am , it is not possible to talk in terms of mor@@ tg@@ ages, contracts or even cred@@ it.
L@@ eg@@ is@@ lation on deter@@ g@@ ents therefore needs to address certain specific issues, princip@@ ally, of course, the bio@@ degradation of sur@@ fact@@ ants.
The reduction of the debt is therefore imper@@ ative, but with certain conditions.
This shows that the disease can be transmitted through f@@ od@@ der or gr@@ ass and might mean that your soil is b@@ ligh@@ ted fore@@ ver and should not be used for breeding cattle.
As a result, Amendment 3@@ 14 to line 19 0@@ 5 0@@ 1 is withdrawn.
Therefore the vote on amendment 9@@ 36 to line 0@@ 8 03 0@@ 1 must be made without the comments on the global energy assessment.
Consequently, Amend@@ ment@@  @@ No@@  @@ 31 is not acceptable.
A lack of regulation of the external quality of plants may therefore cause very serious problems as this will allow all sizes of plant to be placed on the market.
Cap@@ ital punish@@ ment, therefore, causes the opposite effect to the one inten@@ ded.
As a result, fresh pla@@ ice is sold at far below the cost price or withdrawn from the market and auc@@ tioned off.
Consequently, the regulation could not be applied under the conditions and for the purposes laid down in the text.
A horiz@@ on@@ tal approach is therefore taken at EU level, with the focus being on comb@@ ating stig@@ m@@ atis@@ ation of and discrimination against people affected by neuro@@ degenerative diseases, neurological development disorders and non-@@ psychiatric brain diseases.
Therefore, the first step is to provide appropriate care for these children.
These do contain residues of modified DNA in a ver@@ ifi@@ able manner.
Therefore, the proposal for the European You@@ th Gu@@ ar@@ an@@ tee initiative should be recommended.
Therefore, cau@@ tion, careful monitoring of events and European assistance for democ@@ rats that reject both sec@@ ular mil@@ it@@ ar@@ ism and reli@@ gious fundament@@ alism are recommended.
Consequently, the quality of administration was particularly important.
As a result, the Rom@@ a issue in Europe must be actively explo@@ red and its progress profession@@ ally monitored.
Thus it is not a question of pen@@ alis@@ ing; you should not re@@ ward products that are not healthy by giving them a lower VA@@ T rat@@ ing.
Consequently, it is research and technology, this important part, which is a necessary but inadequate condition for growth.
The resolution makes sen@@ se, there@@ fore.
Therefore, safety can only be achieved with an ou@@ tri@@ ght b@@ an.
Therefore, there is no room for a solution based on exclus@@ ive claim@@ s.
Combin@@ ing A and B@@  @@ quot@@ as would therefore mean that many Member States would risk no longer being self-@@ sufficient in sug@@ ar.
As a result, in@@ surance does not cover the cost of treatment.
Sweden therefore em@@ its 60 times more, and the EU 100 times more, than E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia, to take just one specific example.
Monitoring of the health of the peoples of the Member States and of health indicators should therefore be a priority for the Community, and the establishment of a permanent system for the monitor@@ ing, evaluation and development of those indicators in the European Union will be an essential element in that regar@@ d.
Consequently, on 27 June 2007 the Commission issued Re@@ as@@ on@@ ed Opin@@ ions to 14 Member States that have not transp@@ os@@ ed Directive 2000@@ /4@@ 3@@ /E@@ C correc@@ tly.
Thus, the water that comes out of the tap is ground@@ water and we can drink it without having to treat it fir@@ st.
Therefore, the welfare of the child must always take prior@@ ity.
So, the aim is to change the wording from ‘@@ too brut@@ al@@ ’ to ‘@@ very signific@@ ant@@ ’.
This means that the proposals are even more regres@@ sive.
Consequently, The Council decided to take the following measures.
That is why the Council was right to include the concep@@ ts of ‘@@ criminal record@@ ’ and ‘@@ un@@ appe@@ al@@ able convic@@ tion@@ ’ among the terms to be defined prior to such decisions.
The Council, therefore, has no compe@@ tence as regards e@@ uth@@ an@@ as@@ ia.
Therefore, the control requested is not necessary.
Therefore, the debate will be adj@@ our@@ ned at no@@ on, as is tradi@@ tion@@ al.
Consequently, there is no reason to doubt that the plan con@@ forms with the Treat@@ y.
So it is at the discre@@ tion of the Commission whether to do it or not.
Therefore, the evaluation mechanism will have to be based on a consistent alloc@@ ation of the tasks currently shared between the first and the third pill@@ ar@@ s.
The time has therefore come to t@@ ame the autom@@ ob@@ il@@ e.
Therefore, now is the time to provide the EU with a legitim@@ ate Commission which is capable of responding to the difficult events of recent times.
Therefore, the total su@@ ms chann@@ elled into agriculture should also be kept up and should be distributed more equ@@ it@@ ably.
Consequently, the number of execu@@ tions has fall@@ en.
Therefore, there will be very great resistance to product plac@@ ement and the blurred b@@ ound@@ ari@@ es.
Therefore the E@@ PL@@ P ab@@ st@@ ain@@ s on this vot@@ e.
There has to be a ch@@ ance, therefore, for Portugal not to be excluded from access to this fun@@ d@@ ing, or at least part of this fun@@ ding.
Therefore, the major effect would be not so much to dist@@ ort as to disrup@@ t the UK market.
Therefore, this is a serious problem.
Consequently, the process should comply with the following conditions, and I support this view@@ :
The report does not therefore provide the necessary balance as better protection is required for the rights of deb@@ tors.
Therefore, it ac@@ commod@@ ates sector build@@ -up in favour of the capit@@ alists whose position as European Union type monopol@@ ies in the international market will be streng@@ then@@ ed.
H@@ ence, with the sole and important exception of the city of T@@ uz@@ l@@ a, the result threat@@ ens to allow room only for the extre@@ mis@@ t nation@@ alist parti@@ es.
As a result, the desired outcome – namely to effect a major shift in what the consumer dec@@ ides when he bu@@ ys a car – would not be achieved, s@@ inc@@ e, if there is only a difference of EUR @@ 80 between a car with 120 g/@@ km emission and a car with 200 g/@@ km emis@@ sions, then the market will remain un@@ affected.
Therefore, the role of women as suffe@@ rer@@ s, main care@@ rs, educ@@ ators and as active members of commun@@ ities in the developing countries is key to finding the right solutions.
So it is good that the United Kingdom and Spain are sol@@ ving the P@@ ino@@ ch@@ et problem for Ch@@ il@@ e.
The port of Hel@@ sing@@ b@@ org@@ , therefore, now has a claim of SE@@ K 2@@ 40 million (approximately EUR 26 milli@@ on@@ ) on the compan@@ y.
Consequently, there are different needs in terms of services and different levels of preparation for active life, especially in the case of people in rural areas.
Thus, soon the c@@ af@@ és in O@@ mon@@ ia S@@ qu@@ are and Syn@@ t@@ ag@@ ma S@@ qu@@ are, especially in the run@@ -up to the O@@ lymp@@ ics, will look like a sc@@ ene from an I@@ an Fle@@ ming or Joh@@ n Le C@@ arr@@ é novel@@ .
The people are accord@@ ingly sc@@ eptic@@ al, it is not that they mis@@ understand the EU, they understand it only too well.
As a consequence of this, the conditions under which dogs such as gre@@ y@@ h@@ ounds are kept and rac@@ ed or used for hun@@ ting within the Member States are not regulated by Community la@@ w.
The message is that biotechnology is controversi@@ al, possibly even dangerous and un@@ detec@@ table.
Therefore the tendency will be – and you heard earlier from Mr Wh@@ it@@ e@@ head about the consum@@ er@@ s’ position – for them to ign@@ ore all claim@@ s.
H@@ ence, the calculated annual costs of ES@@ C 1 000 per motor vehic@@ le, and ES@@ C 1 800 per dies@@ el vehicle may not even appl@@ y, as a result of the technological evol@@ ution leading to the production of better cars with lower consumption.
Therefore, de@@ pic@@ tions of a com@@ ic@@ -@@ oper@@ a dictator@@ ship led by a jo@@ vial par@@ l@@ our revolu@@ tionary are fal@@ se.
Consequently, both parties must take the necessary measures and action to stop this magnitude of illegal activity.
Therefore, nuclear safety assess@@ ments, research and checks must be continu@@ ous.
Women therefore already have to deal with more uncertain@@ ty, poor acc@@ ru@@ al of pen@@ sions and inadequate medical ex@@ pens@@ es.
As a result, women are more affected than men by persistent pover@@ ty.
In those cases, the operational funds - which are a very small percentage of this global production per hecta@@ re, some 1.5 or 2% - are a reasonable amount to work with.
In the process, immigrants have sometimes been stig@@ mati@@ sed, v@@ il@@ ifi@@ ed, even de-@@ human@@ ised.
As a result, ine@@ qual@@ ities in scientific development will be intensi@@ fied.
So information about storage, transport or processing must be in the public dom@@ ain.
Consequently, the same safeguar@@ ds are not required for medicines given to hor@@ ses.
As a consequ@@ ence, the internal measures that need to be taken must be adapted to the specific situations in the respective countries.
Therefore, the billi@@ ons that you referred to are not accurate amoun@@ ts.
As a result, the negotiations under way at the time under Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an medi@@ ation were b@@ low@@ n out of the water and could only be continued with great difficulty outside the EU.
Therefore, EU support is necessary.
Consequently, the pre@@ occu@@ pati@@ ons of the visually impaired have been ver@@ y, very larg@@ ely, I would say almost enti@@ rel@@ y, taken into consideration.
Questions to the Council will therefore only last one hour.
It must therefore have something to do with specifically European conditions.
Consequently, the reven@@ ue must be e@@ arm@@ ark@@ ed.
Consequently, the rules of the game have been modified during the mat@@ ch, to the dis@@ advantage of the two play@@ ers.

The following steps need to be taken without delay@@ :
We may need to set up a quality evaluation programme for this purpos@@ e, as is done in regular education.
To do this, the EU should ann@@ oun@@ ce its '@@ market@@ ', its '@@ competi@@ tion' and its enlargement to other countries in the framework of the so-called '@@ energy commun@@ iti@@ es@@ ', the '@@ En@@ erg@@ y Char@@ ter Treat@@ y' - ensuring '@@ security of invest@@ ment@@ ' and guarante@@ eing a '@@ right to compensation in the event of ex@@ pro@@ pri@@ ation and/or nation@@ alis@@ ation' - or the inclusion of an '@@ energy security cl@@ a@@ use@@ ' in commercial agre@@ ements.
However, for that to happen, a better found@@ ation is required at this side of the oc@@ e@@ an.
The points we consider particularly important are as follows:
It would require unanim@@ ous change to make them available.
To do so will involve developing a trac@@ king system, in which every single purch@@ ase or sale of such weapons is recorded by being entered in an international regist@@ er, thus making it possible to trace a specific weap@@ on back to its origin and to its manufacturer@@ , and to determine who was responsible for it being sold and who for it being passed on.
This requires a minimum of two th@@ ing@@ s; super@@ markets to sell the products and consumers to buy them.
To do this, it is first necessary to know the specific char@@ acter of the service which is on off@@ er.
In order for this to happen, investment is needed.
Those who deliver such warnings need credi@@ bility and integr@@ ity, and you pos@@ s@@ ess both those qual@@ ities.
The population must be involv@@ ed; employees must have a sa@@ y.
In order to achieve this, they must be given the necessary le@@ e@@ way.
We must therefore have many more women in work, and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a short@@ fall@@ .
A ban on nuclear testing is part and par@@ ce@@ l of this process, to the same extent as the continuation of the ST@@ AR@@ T process and the ver@@ ifi@@ able reduction in f@@ is@@ sion@@ able materi@@ al.
We therefore need to pay fore@@ stry workers to create fi@@ re-@@ breaks or fi@@ re-@@ lan@@ es, 50 to 60 metres w@@ ide.
For this purpos@@ e, every Member State has to design@@ ate a national reference laboratory which is responsib@@ le, in particular, for the control of marine bi@@ otox@@ ins.
For that, more time is needed.
In the process, there is to be a critical examination of all the fields of application in which antibio@@ tically active substances are used, namely in human and veterinary medicine and in animal feed.
They do not es@@ che@@ w highly re@@ pres@@ sive mean@@ s.
To this end, the Commission proposed to reduce the amount of cycl@@ am@@ ates permitted in soft drinks and to prohib@@ it their use in a series of other foodstuff@@ s, such as conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ er@@ y, che@@ wing g@@ um and ice cre@@ am.
This is why the Commission has proposed the European cur@@ ricul@@ um vit@@ ae, to be replaced in due course by the port@@ foli@@ o system.
In order to achieve this, the new Commission must tackle some major issues, both at internal and international level.
Cont@@ act in this regard must be made via the expor@@ ter@@ 's own tax office and not that of the import@@ ing Member St@@ ate.
Member States must offer scre@@ en@@ ings at two-year intervals for women between the ages of 50 and 69 years, as recommen@@ ded, in fact, in the European Guidelines for M@@ am@@ m@@ ography S@@ cre@@ en@@ ing;
This would necessitate inter@@ connection of rout@@ es.
For that to happen, the training and support mechanisms need to be in place to ensure implementation as well as efficient monitoring and sanc@@ tions for non-@@ compli@@ ance.
The additional measures announc@@ ed by the Commissioner will therefore still be needed.
To this end, the scientists have reviewed all the scientific literature published since the last opinion on aspart@@ ame - amoun@@ ting to around 150 arti@@ cles.
The only way to do that is to have some effective tem@@ plate from which this can be made.
We did this through the European N@@ et@@ work for Di@@ ag@@ no@@ s@@ tics of '@@ Import@@ ed@@ ' Viral Dis@@ eas@@ es, which is funded under the public health programme.
In order to do this however, a minimum number of samples is required.
For this purpose a sound budget is allocated with joint financ@@ ing.
This can be achieved by stipul@@ ating that no more than 70% of the aid is to go to the actual ac@@ re@@ age, a target that can be reached by removing the higher amount of aid for protein crops and by promoting exten@@ si@@ fication by setting an upper limit of 0.5 units of livestock per hecta@@ re.
For this to happen, several problems need to be resolved.
Flex@@ ibility on the part of all sides is a requirement for this.
To do this an hon@@ est bro@@ ker is needed.
We need data, but some Member States fail to provide that data or their data is in@@ complet@@ e.
For that, two conditions are necessary.
In order to this, we would have to le@@ ase five H@@ erc@@ u@@ le C 130 type aircraf@@ t; this is a very effective land@@ -based aeroplan@@ e with delayed drop@@ ping and a capacity of 12 tonnes.
One of the pre@@ requis@@ ites of this is control of women@@ ' s sex@@ u@@ ality and fertilit@@ y.
In order to clear the rub@@ ble@@ , you need heavy lif@@ ting machin@@ er@@ y, cr@@ an@@ es, hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ters, bul@@ l@@ doz@@ ers and the capacity to drive them.
That needs political heav@@ y@@ weigh@@ ts like K@@ oh@@ l, Wa@@ ig@@ er and S@@ to@@ ib@@ er, and not SP@@ D ligh@@ t@@ weigh@@ ts like Sch@@ r@@ ö@@ der and L@@ af@@ on@@ tain@@ e.
This entail@@ s providing objective information about the medicin@@ es' characteristics and the diseases for which they are recommen@@ ded, as well as preventing the provision of un@@ sol@@ ic@@ ited information or dis@@ gu@@ ised advertis@@ ing.
This should be provided for by la@@ w.
For that to happen, justice must be done.
That means more resources de@@ voted to an improved Operation At@@ lan@@ ta, which already exists and which has been successful in terms of a reduction in the number of vessels seiz@@ ed in 200@@ 9 as compared with 2008.
Some information will therefore need to be pre-@@ vet@@ ted.
These include groun@@ d-@@ to-@@ air mis@@ sil@@ es.
For this, the whole chain has to be examin@@ ed, from raw material down to waste.
In order to achieve this, jobs and industrial output must be kept within the European Union and not re@@ located to third countries.
To that end, monitoring is required.
For this, a measure of self-@@ criticism is necessary.
Effective m@@ iti@@ g@@ ation requires a rapid response@@ : the longer an accident is allowed to go un@@ check@@ ed, the wid@@ er the imp@@ act.
It is the opposite with the Via Bal@@ tic@@ a situation.
For them, it is time to get down to work.
As far as the procedures are concerned reference is also made to the fact that the maximum transparency is required and that all the necessary information should be placed at the disposal of the plain@@ ti@@ ff as it could be used in cour@@ t.
For those with the insi@@ ght to re@@ alise it, that was a dangerous ill@@ usion even at that time.
For the me@@ e@@ k, unknown.
But for the bra@@ ve, opportun@@ ity.
According to this President, Je@@ ws and black people have to be arrest@@ ed, ga@@ oled and ex@@ il@@ ed.
As far as the Commission is concerned, there is nothing new about the mal@@ function@@ ings which have recently come to light.
Reg@@ ar@@ ding the previous period, the Commission will conclude its final check on addi@@ tion@@ ality at the end of 2002.
As far as the distribution of the burden between the Member States is concerned, it exists.
As regards avi@@ ation, the study was brought to comple@@ tion in 2004.
In connection with water, for example, we read@@ : "@@ phas@@ ing out the discharge of hazardous substanc@@ es@@ " .
With regard to the percentage of fra@@ u@@ dul@@ ent du@@ plic@@ ations, it should be borne in mind that, once a du@@ plication has been identified, each case does not involve one person, but at least two.
With regard to the drinks that are affected by these labelling measures, and which are mentioned in Article 6@@ (3@@ ), we should add to these arom@@ ati@@ sed wine-@@ based bever@@ ages and arom@@ ati@@ sed wine-@@ product cock@@ tail@@ s, which are gover@@ ned by Regulation 16@@ 01@@ /9@@ 1@@ /E@@ EC@@ .
We have discussed this with the other groups.
A similar positive development in the case of beef has been ec@@ lip@@ sed by the effects of BSE@@ .
As to G@@ AL@@ I@@ LE@@ O, it will continue to receive 20% of its funding from the Commun@@ ity.
Also, when it comes to the 10-@@ metre stri@@ ps, there are - believe it or not - chemicals that you can use in water cour@@ ses.
Also, as to the claim that they are not profit@@ -@@ making organis@@ ations, that was not always the case of those NG@@ Os which I have wit@@ nes@@ sed.
As for the ‘@@ suffici@@ ent@@ ’ classi@@ fic@@ ation, it would only be acceptable if this were taken as a minimum quality require@@ ment, to be improved by a specified tight dead@@ line, which was not the case.
On TRI@@ P@@ S, the EU should maintain a strong and determined lead@@ er@@ ship.
On the vertebral colum@@ n, the Commission intention is to require the removal of the vertebral column where there are doub@@ ts over the effectiveness of the ban on meat and bone meal or whenever it cannot be demonstrated that animals are highly unlikely to be inc@@ ub@@ ating BSE@@ .
Com@@ it@@ olog@@ y:
As for the Cont@@ act Committe@@ e, its work is continuing and the results will be published on the web in early 2005.
Concer@@ ning the conc@@ ession regarding transport over the B@@ ren@@ ner Pas@@ s, as mentioned by Mr M@@ ess@@ n@@ er, this conc@@ ession is still out@@ stand@@ ing.
As for the de@@ dic@@ ation of doct@@ ors, y@@ es, there is enormous de@@ dic@@ ation there but I do not feel safe at the hands of a doctor who has been on call for 72 hours and is swa@@ ying with tiredness while he is trying to make a decision how to treat me.
As regards the detection of the addition of por@@ k or beef protein following enzym@@ atic treatment to destroy the DNA@@ , this will be examined by the Commission Services with the experts from the Member States.
As regards determin@@ ing and rever@@ sing tren@@ ds in the quality of ground@@ water, the Commission agre@@ es with Amendment 37 on the attention which needs to be given to increases in concentrations as a result of human activity.
As for the addition of sugar, our rejection is based on the fact that a permitted increase to 4.@@ 5% vol@@ . and the use of the term '@@ w@@ ine@@ ' for drinks which are not made from grap@@ es will down@@ grade the quality and special characteristics of w@@ ine.
On the length of the I@@ G@@ C, if Member States seek to un@@ pic@@ k one part of the de@@ al, others will pull at it too and the whole f@@ ab@@ ric risks un@@ ra@@ vel@@ ling.
As for how to prevent it, I think there are three essential fact@@ ors.
For France, the Commission decided on 18 July 2001 to apply to the Court for in@@ complete transp@@ osi@@ tion.
The age of application varies from 58 to 6@@ 7.
Progres@@ s has also been made in terms of the management of centralised actions.
There is certainly no comparison in terms of the scale of the disast@@ er, but there are similar@@ ities.
As for breast-fe@@ ed@@ ing, women with mater@@ n@@ ity leave lasting 18 weeks would have sufficient time to breast-fe@@ ed their children, without having to adjust their working hours.
As far as Amendment No 21 on frag@@ r@@ ance list@@ ing is concerned, this amendment requires a full ingredient list@@ ing, including per@@ fum@@ e com@@ position.
As regards n@@ v@@ C@@ J@@ D, there are indeed concerns that a new and additional risk may be posed by blood and blood products prepared from don@@ ations from infected don@@ ors.
In relation to the "@@ Mex@@ ic@@ o City Pol@@ icy@@ " of the US Administration referred to in the report, the European Commission does not see itself in a position to comment or re@@ act.
Reg@@ ar@@ ding the Irish position, Constitu@@ tional ar@@ ticle 4@@ 0.@@ 3.3 "@@ acknowledg@@ es the right to life of the unborn with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother@@ ".
As far as the first question is concerned, progress has not been exactly spec@@ tac@@ ul@@ ar.
When it comes to the protection of workers, the question is, '@@ what steps can the European Commission take to prevent the creation of first@@ - and second-@@ class citiz@@ ens@@ ?'
As for aer@@ ial spra@@ ying, what is proposed is no less than the use of biological weap@@ ons.
With regard to the 24 months, I as@@ sume that you are refer@@ ring to the fact that there is a requirement to test animals above the age of 30 months.
As for the question on safety, M@@ G@@ P IV in fact provides for the establishment of facilities to increase safety at se@@ a, provided these are compatible with the need to con@@ serve resourc@@ es.
With regard to Article 5, which sets out the maximum quantities of vitamins and minerals in food supplements, according to letters a), b) and c) of paragraph 1, I think it is necessary to keep these sec@@ tions, as the approach that we should take in Europe should be stric@@ t, maintaining control of the maximum level of vitamins and minerals based on the maximum safe intake levels.
Tur@@ ning to the situation in Col@@ om@@ bi@@ a, preliminary official figures show that the number of dead has risen to over 9@@ 00@@ , of whom 58@@ 2 are in the Department of Qu@@ in@@ di@@ o and the number of injured to approximately 3 400@@ , and 200 000 persons are hom@@ el@@ ess.
After that, it will be necessary to think again.
As far as the oil content in car ty@@ res is concerned, as IS@@ O 2@@ 14@@ 61 method has been developed in order to detect this type of o@@ ils in ty@@ res, it is proposed that it be defined in the directive as an ad@@ den@@ du@@ m to the Commission proposal.
In relation to trans@@ mis@@ sion, there is no evidence of any other form of transmission of BSE other than the two that have been identified, which are feed and maternal trans@@ mis@@ sion.
With T@@ B we need to recognise the link to AIDS – the multi-@@ drug resistance versions which kill two million a year.
As regards T@@ B, the ma@@ them@@ atics are similar but it is more difficult to eradic@@ ate.
With regard to avi@@ ation, can the Union not take the lead as regards measures to make avi@@ ation more sustain@@ able?
There are pre@@ concep@@ tions and pre@@ judic@@ es surrounding sexual violence which have yet to be disp@@ el@@ led.
As for the substance at hand in the re@@ solution, the treatment of children in the nor@@ thern part of U@@ g@@ anda is of serious concern.
In the case of the 2003 implement@@ ation, the beginning of the year even shows a lower level than during the same period of 200@@ 2@@ ; in particular, category 3 and 4 commit@@ ments entered into in April were lower than at the same time last year.
So the impact of the m@@ erger in this market has to be seen in a wid@@ er perspec@@ tive than the situation in Denmark, while the other problems were mainly related to the situation inside Denmark@@ .
As regards the information which must be provided when animals are slaugh@@ te@@ red, the Commission can also agree to allow flex@@ ib@@ ility.
On the inter@@ net side, it is even technically un@@ feas@@ ible.
On obes@@ ity, evidence shows that the problem is much more about how much exercise people take rather than just how much food they e@@ at.
This is not so for the use of phthal@@ ates in to@@ ys.
With regard to use, risk has to be the central fact@@ or, taking hazard and exposure into consideration.
As for spreading European cul@@ ture, well make the most of it, because the way this c@@ raz@@ y EU is go@@ ing, there will be none lef@@ t, just a meaning@@ less man@@ tra@@ : '@@ United in Di@@ ver@@ sit@@ y@@ '.
As for the other 2@@ 39 post@@ s, the Council had not adopted a position on this matter on 20 Jul@@ y.
On Amendments 46 and 8@@ 2, I should provide some further clar@@ ification about the daily limit value of PM@@ 10.
As regards animals not being trac@@ ed, I would like the Commission to see if it could look at some sort of strict regulation on gre@@ y@@ h@@ ound breeding and the export of gre@@ y@@ h@@ oun@@ ds.
As regards CD@@ s, they are by their very nature easily transport@@ able and, therefore, if the rates diff@@ er, there is a clear inevit@@ ability of a distor@@ tion of the internal market.
On the issue of the certain other substances, I propose a definition of the other substances, as the vitamins and minerals allowed for for@@ tification are listed and thus defined in Annex@@ es@@  @@ I and II.
For cephal@@ op@@ od tra@@ w@@ l@@ ers, the gro@@ ss registered tonn@@ age has been reduced from 4@@ 000 to 3000 G@@ RT per year.
In the field of conc@@ ili@@ ations, it is the case that the reform of Regulation (EEC) No 40@@ 64@@ /@@ 89 has not been as radic@@ al a change as the one which has taken place, for example, in the field of anti-@@ competitive behaviour@@ .
As to the external expendit@@ ure, there is a marked increase in the total amounts because of the new and reinforced pre-@@ accession assistance.
Waste heat produced at a c@@ ogen@@ eration plant has a potentially wid@@ er use than is the case at present. It may also be used, for example, for cool@@ ing, water puri@@ fication and air condition@@ ing.
Also, in relation to rele@@ ases into the se@@ a, in 198@@ 3 S@@ ell@@ af@@ iel@@ d leak@@ ed high-@@ level waste into the se@@ a.
Some of the provisions on labelling could also be re@@ wor@@ ded and made more consum@@ er@@ -friend@@ ly.
As for what happened in K@@ ath@@ mand@@ u - a place reno@@ wn@@ ed in s@@ ong and stor@@ y, and that even makes it sad@@ der - up to 10 000 votes were not allowed to be coun@@ ted.
As far as Rom@@ a women are concerned, there are approximately 8 to 10 million Rom@@ a in Europe, although the still tradi@@ tionally nom@@ adi@@ c nature of this people means current figures are un@@ reli@@ able.
And with respect to high vol@@ t@@ age electrical power lin@@ es, a threshold vol@@ t@@ age of 2@@ 25 k@@ V was chos@@ en, which is completely in@@ comprehen@@ sible, or perhaps completely comprehen@@ sible, given that the largest proportion of projects are at 220 k@@ V.
As regards the national measures mentioned in the question, should more information on the specific circumstances become available to the Commission, these special circumstances will be assessed in the light of the j@@ ur@@ is@@ prud@@ ence of the cour@@ t.
As to the standard of nutrition inside the c@@ amp@@ s, EC@@ HO contributes one third of the total cost of the World Food Programme in Tan@@ z@@ ania, which provides a bal@@ anced daily ration of 2@@ 16@@ 6 cal@@ ories per refuge@@ e, well over the minimum recommended by the WHO@@ .
As for NO@@ x and the nitrogen oxid@@ es, progress was only made with the greatest difficul@@ ty.
For the control bodies that are listed in paragraph 5, I agree in principle to the request for formal ac@@ cred@@ it@@ ation, but adequate governmental supervision should also be acceptable as an alternative in that situation.
With regard to egg products and other products of animal orig@@ in, we could label them according to the system that already applies to egg@@ s, in other words, a system that indicates the conditions under which the animals have been re@@ are@@ d.
In the F@@ lan@@ ders region which fall under 5@@ b payments amount to less than 3 %, and in Me@@ et@@ j@@ es@@ land less than 1 %.
As for the answ@@ ers, they are top secre@@ t.
Concer@@ ning sanc@@ tions and enforc@@ ement@@ : Amendment 64 inser@@ ts a new Article 84@@ (2@@ a) indicating that as long as a holder of a fishing authorisation has been given '@@ penal@@ ty point@@ s' the holder should be excluded from receiving EU subsidies or national public aid during that time.
As for the areas covered by the plans and entitled to aid, the percentage should be re@@ tained on the basis of the area cer@@ ti@@ fied in the last year@@ 's plans and not the area for which aid has been request@@ ed.
As far as tuna vessels are concerned, the number of lic@@ ences that may be granted has been substantially increas@@ ed: from 26 to 37 for se@@ in@@ ers; and from 16 to 52 for po@@ le-@@ and-@@ line vessels and lon@@ glin@@ ers. This is appropriate given the large extent to which the fishing possibil@@ ities in this sector were u@@ ti@@ li@@ zed under the previous protoc@@ ol.
In the case of transpor@@ t, there is a long-term goal of a 70% reduction, but for energy it is 75@@ %.
For Cher@@ no@@ b@@ yl@@ , important EU support is related to turning the s@@ arc@@ opha@@ g@@ us into an environment@@ ally acceptable system and addres@@ sing social need@@ s.
In regard to your second question, I will have to check this and obtain information before I can re@@ ply.
With regard to your own constitu@@ ency of W@@ ex@@ for@@ d, Mrs Do@@ y@@ le, I do not have any reports of the rum@@ ours that you reported.
Where c@@ od is concerned, the stock situation appears to be more serious, requiring rather more severe measures than those proposed for ha@@ k@@ e, although they could vary according to the speci@@ es.
Perhaps with regard to Cam@@ bodi@@ a, there was form@@ er@@ ly the desire to give the country time to norm@@ alise and rec@@ over from the K@@ h@@ mer Rou@@ ge er@@ a, but the time limit is now fast approach@@ ing.
For cervical cancer, the pa@@ p s@@ me@@ ar has proved its wor@@ th.
With regard to the scop@@ e, it has been agreed with the Council that the rules will in any case apply to amounts exceeding 10 kg.
With regard to cycl@@ am@@ ate, a Dan@@ ish study showed that excess consumption of it can be harmful for the weak@@ est among us, pregnant women and children under the age of thre@@ e.
With regard to dec@@ a@@ B@@ DE@@ , on which there are as yet no negative conclus@@ ions, the ban must, in the view of the P@@ PE@@ -@@ DE Grou@@ p, be re@@ voc@@ able, hence dependent on the results of the risk assessment which will be available before the end of the year.
As regards the functioning of the Ag@@ ency, the development of the rail@@ ways in recent dec@@ ades has not produced what we had hop@@ ed.
As for the le@@ ver, you have described all the appropriate mechanisms in your ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating proposal, which is exc@@ iting in so many respec@@ ts.
As regards the current Ombuds@@ man, there are also positive sign@@ s, not least the appreci@@ able increase in the number of complaints du@@ ly dealt with (@@ 30% in 200@@ 4).
On the question of trans@@ mis@@ sion, the principal way SAR@@ S appears to be spread is through respiratory secre@@ tions called dro@@ ple@@ ts, nam@@ ely, when someone with SAR@@ S cough@@ s or s@@ nee@@ z@@ es dro@@ ple@@ ts into the air and someone else breath@@ es them in.
As regards the issue of the ‘@@ mod@@ el@@ ’ chos@@ en, which consists of a finger@@ print printed as numbers on a bar co@@ de, there is no inter@@ oper@@ ability problem, either with passp@@ orts or with vis@@ as, since finger@@ prin@@ ts will be included in both propos@@ als, hence they are compar@@ able.
When it comes to the concentration cap for parti@@ cles, we wish to reduce this to ten micrograms, so putting it at the same level as that recommended for industri@@ alised countries by the World Health Organisation (@@ WHO@@ ).
With regard to the report containing the scientific data on s@@ ard@@ ines, this data has twice been passed to the International Council for the Ex@@ pl@@ oration of the Se@@ a, a body which b@@ rings together the leading scientists in this field, including those from Portug@@ al.
As to the Dublin Regulation and the Euro@@ da@@ c Regul@@ ation, important progress has been made at technical level.
I will have to give some more thought to the role to be played by the Council, and will leave you to imagine it as R@@ ud@@ ol@@ f or as San@@ ta@@ ’s little hel@@ per@@ s.
With regard to sug@@ ar@@ ing, any use of sucro@@ se for enrich@@ ment purposes should be indicated on the lab@@ el, so as to achieve greater transparency and consumer information.
As for the educ@@ ation@@ /@@ research@@ /@@ innov@@ ation tri@@ ang@@ le, the simpl@@ istic solution of in@@ discrimin@@ ately injec@@ ting money into research must be avoided.
For non-@@ agricultural products, the Doh@@ a Dec@@ lar@@ ation forese@@ es: '@@ ... negotiations which shall aim ... to reduce or as appropriate eliminate t@@ ari@@ ff@@ s, including the reduction or elimination of tar@@ iff pe@@ ak@@ s, high t@@ ari@@ ff@@ s and tar@@ iff escal@@ ation, as well as non-@@ tar@@ iff barri@@ ers, in particular on products of export interest to developing countri@@ es@@ .'
Some of them b@@ are@@ ly reach 35% of the Union aver@@ age.
For some foods it is better than other techniqu@@ es, for others it is not.
If some companies had their way, it would be possible to drive without any time restric@@ tions, during the day, at night, during week@@ ends and on bank holid@@ ay@@ s.
For certain to@@ wed ge@@ ar, the minimum mes@@ h size will be set as@@ : either a squ@@ are@@ -@@ mes@@ hed net with a 40 mm mes@@ h at the c@@ od end or, at the du@@ ly justified request of the ship own@@ er, a 50 mm di@@ am@@ ond mes@@ h net with acknowledged size selec@@ tivity equivalent to or higher than that of the 40 mm squ@@ are@@ -@@ mes@@ hed ne@@ ts.
For some States, however, this sort of n@@ ine-@@ year period will not be sufficient to carry out the necessary adjust@@ ments.
In some Member States, it would appear that each vessel is inspec@@ ted once every ten years, a figure which might just as well be zer@@ o.
For some sp@@ ark@@ ling w@@ ines that are obtained in aut@@ oc@@ lav@@ es using agitation, a shorter period will su@@ ffic@@ e.
In respect of certain essential parameters such as pestic@@ ides, chlor@@ inated solvents and tri@@ hal@@ ome@@ than@@ es, its response has been entirely inadequ@@ ate, considering that many of these are carcinogenic substances.
For some older patients this can be more important than the treatment of their medical condition itsel@@ f.
For some people, the short@@ age of care leads to premature death and for others, it leads to such a poor quality of life that they choose to die by means of voluntary e@@ uth@@ an@@ as@@ ia long before they have reached the natural stage of dy@@ ing.
For some countries br@@ ack@@ ets have been left in the system, and there are some gl@@ aring inst@@ ances of distor@@ tion of the fact@@ s, such as the alloc@@ ation to Estonia of the same number of seats as Mal@@ ta, although it has three times the population.
For certain smaller Member States, in the case of territ@@ ori@@ alis@@ ation, the Commission might consider author@@ ising higher aid intensi@@ ties on a cas@@ e-@@ by-@@ case basis, if it is established that the 50% aid intensity level would not ensure cultural production because the cultural area and market diff@@ usion were limited.
For some drugs with a low tur@@ no@@ ver, the six-@@ month extension may prove necessary after all in order to rec@@ ou@@ p the costs.
For certain products, it cannot be the market.
When using some products, including those used daily by man@@ y, information about the substances they contain is vital if they are to be used safely and in a way that does not end@@ ang@@ er health.
Concer@@ ning those amend@@ ments, namely at position B@@ 5-@@ 3@@ 25 on funding for the HO@@ SP@@ IT@@ AL@@ IT@@ Y Programme and at position B@@ 7-@@ 8@@ 30, the Committee on Bud@@ gets not only del@@ eted the su@@ ms in question but also went as far as del@@ eting those two positions enti@@ rel@@ y.
This national certific@@ ation, which is carried out by CH@@ A in Germany or S@@ OP@@ EX@@ A in France, is subject to a notification require@@ ment. In other words, these certific@@ ations must be noti@@ fied.
For these custom@@ ers, security of supply is not a market issue and does not influence their choice of provi@@ der.
For this sector@@ , as for service st@@ ations, there must be either an exception to the general rule or a sector@@ -@@ by-@@ sector approach within the general regulatory frame@@ work.
Such children require a special approach and a person@@ alised style of teach@@ ing.
For these women, achieving these rights and this control entail@@ s being able fre@@ ely to choose the number of children they have, as well as the g@@ aps between the birth of one child and the nex@@ t.
For those women, the AB@@ C prevention method – Ab@@ stin@@ ence, Be@@ ing fa@@ ith@@ ful and Con@@ dom@@ s@@ – is anything but sufficient.
For these groups of refuge@@ es, rese@@ tt@@ lement can be the only solution.
If you have ide@@ as, please help me out and pass them on to me.
For these millions and for Is@@ la@@ m there is no place for terrorists like him or any others, who@@ ever they are and where@@ ver they come fro@@ m.
F@@ org@@ ed customs st@@ amps were used in all this.
For these countries, the crisis was the last nail in the co@@ ff@@ in.
For these individu@@ als, de@@ vo@@ tion to the health sector is both a service and a call@@ ing.
G@@ AT@@ T sett@@ les such questions on the basis of the SP@@ S, the san@@ itary and phy@@ to-@@ san@@ itary co@@ de, which is a scientific co@@ de.
These three sectors need suitable working hours and rest period@@ s, acceptable compens@@ ations must be arrang@@ ed with a method for calcul@@ ating working time over a 28@@ -day period and another for 36@@ 5 days in order to calcul@@ ate retire@@ ment@@ ; th@@ us, in future it will be easy to control this in road transport with the introduction of the new tach@@ ograp@@ h 1 B.
In the case of the lat@@ ter, 2007 was actually its first year of operation.
For this same reason it is necessary for us to reach our decision by oral procedure.
For the same reason, it was also necessary to grant to the Member States the possibility of taking national measures regarding certain categories of p@@ yro@@ techn@@ ic arti@@ cles.
Li@@ ke@@ wise for this reason, Parliament would have preferred a differen@@ t, more institu@@ tionally appropriate and less politically risk@@ y procedure, such as Article 35@@ 2, either alone or in combination with Article 1@@ 36@@ .
T@@ ro@@ ops could be pul@@ led from the Nor@@ dic batt@@ le groups for this operation.
For this reason, it should come under the proposed five year exemp@@ tion, which will allow a careful analysis of the information that labels should inclu@@ de.
For that reason it is essential to maintain Article 33 and that quantities to be tran@@ ship@@ ped are weighed by an independent body before they are taken on the transport vess@@ el.
That is why it is most important to establish specifically that the term '@@ produc@@ er@@ ' means not only the manufacturer of the finished product, but also the produc@@ er of a raw material or component part of a product.
For this reason, the Commission sup@@ ports the tex@@ t, even if it does introduce separate treatment for minor infring@@ ements and repeated minor infring@@ ements.
Consequently, the overall implementation of this set of guidelines that has prev@@ ail@@ ed in many countries, as formul@@ ated in the report, can only lead to disast@@ rous results, some of them recogn@@ ised, as a matter of fact, in the report both in the number of teen@@ age pregnancies and in the alarm@@ ing spread of sexually transmitted diseases despite all the information that is so widely distrib@@ uted.
Therefore the solution that was agreed - and unanim@@ ously approved - was the establishment of an intermedi@@ ate category for these objec@@ ts which was slightly higher than that for dra@@ w@@ ings and a lot lower than that for pa@@ int@@ ings.
Therefore '@@ be@@ aut@@ y con@@ test@@ s' between the various operators are clearly more consum@@ er@@ -friend@@ ly altern@@ atives.
The criteria according to which concentrations are approved or rejec@@ ted may therefore differ from the criteria used to analyse the effect on competition and its potential effici@@ ency.
For this reason, the pilot studies due to be carried out by the European Commission will be very en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ing.
For that reason, Slovak produc@@ ers, for example, had to replace the word '@@ rum@@ ' with a different design@@ ation, because the Slovak bever@@ age was not made from sugar can@@ e using the original meth@@ od.
For this reason, their administration procedures should be clarified.
For this reason, the agency responsible for reconstruction should not be sp@@ lit up into two separate areas, but must be in one place, and it should be independent with sufficient authority to take decisions.
This work therefore, log@@ ically, has to be undertaken confidenti@@ ally.
N@@ ik@@ iti@@ n should thus be given a fair trial and ex@@ on@@ erated by a civil cour@@ t.
That is why so far we do not have the saf@@ est basis that there could be, namely not paying with your sign@@ ature but following the same procedure as with cas@@ h dispen@@ ser@@ s, whereby there is a chi@@ p on these plastic car@@ ds and you sign with a sequ@@ ence of four numbers which only you know, in other words a chi@@ p and a P@@ IN@@ .
For this reason, a single system for use at European level has been designed and developed and is currently being install@@ ed on major international lines and trains in Europe.
For these particular posi@@ tions, however, I regard personal and professional experience as crucial fact@@ ors, and aud@@ itors simply do not pos@@ s@@ ess these attri@@ b@@ utes in sufficient measure at the age of 25, 30 or 35@@ .
No extr@@ act@@ -@@ specific data are required in this type of evid@@ ence.
In such cases, it will clearly be difficult to state the country of origin.
For those of us who like beef on the b@@ one, what is the justi@@ fic@@ ation?
For those of you that are not so technolog@@ ically enab@@ led, L@@ inux is a competi@@ tor to Win@@ do@@ ws that is own@@ ed and updated by the us@@ ers.
For those who are interest@@ ed, the details are on the website.
For those see@@ king help to return to work - in Sandw@@ ich, Kent and An@@ do@@ ver, Hampshire - there is little justification in saying '@@ no@@ ', and this is another UK Government le@@ t-@@ down.
It is a del@@ usion if any@@ body in this place thinks you we@@ re.
For those who do not know, synerg@@ istic effects are a mixture of chemicals possibly used on a crop@@ , and there is no particular definition of how they are trace@@ able.
For those who do not know it, St Lu@@ ci@@ a is a very h@@ illy country in which it will take you more than an hour to drive a distance of 20 k@@ m.
For those who have not seen it, we can make sure you receive cop@@ ies.
For those who may not be posi@@ tioned correc@@ tly, additional man cover has been provided, and the co@@ ach can change people around at any time and, if necessary, send them off the pit@@ ch.

The question remain@@ s: will this Directive allow frag@@ mentation into 15 different approval system@@ s?
The issue is whether this is at all necessary.

The result was that these guidelines have been reduced to formul@@ a@@ ic and generalised declar@@ ations of principle which comm@@ it no@@ -@@ one.
The result is that this off@@ ence is defined in a vag@@ ue mann@@ er, so that it can cover very different types of cases, and not just illegal immigr@@ ation.

It has done nothing after 70 years of commun@@ ist terro@@ r, after one hundred million deaths.
There is no evidence from the United Kingdom of less cho@@ ice, higher prices or of any reduction in specialist book@@ shop@@ s.
You are not oblig@@ ed to do so by treaty or for any other reas@@ on.
No other method should be allowed now.
This has not happen@@ ed.

There have been no changes in the management process compared with UR@@ B@@ AN 1, but it can be taken as read that the positive aspects of UR@@ B@@ AN 1 have been incorpor@@ ated into UR@@ B@@ AN 2.
Nothing has been shel@@ v@@ ed.
There is no authorisation for others to use it in trans@@ ac@@ tions, to appropriate it, to pass it on to others or to dispose of it in heav@@ en knows what other ways.
The system is also the sa@@ me@@ : it is still Mal@@ th@@ us@@ ian and budget@@ ar@@ ist.
There is no reason for this course of action.
Nothing justifi@@ es rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ ing the value of human life.
Nor is there any justification for the derog@@ ations allowing young people of less than 18 years of age to work more than 40 hours per week, over 8 hours per day [@@ Article 8@@ (5@@ )@@ ], and do night work [@@ Article 9@@ (2@@ )@@ ].
There has been no reason to re-@@ evaluate that advice.
Nor is there anything to prevent the grow@@ er from ch@@ op@@ ping down the least productive tre@@ es, or, once he has ch@@ op@@ ped down these tre@@ es, from using the income he then gets from the EU to manage the other tre@@ es more intensi@@ vel@@ y.
There is nothing more an@@ no@@ ying than to see a neigh@@ b@@ our or competi@@ tor che@@ at.
There is nothing to ensure that only animals born after 1 August 199@@ 6, aged between 6 and 30 months, are put on the market
There is no way we can justify a motor@@ cycle with just one passenger em@@ it@@ ting 17 times as much pollution as a motor car with up to four passeng@@ ers.
There is nothing to stop marketing of traditional siz@@ es; there is nothing to stop the use of traditional measures such as pin@@ ts and p@@ oun@@ ds.
No cause could ever justify such a ter@@ ri@@ fying act of col@@ d-@@ blood@@ ed barbar@@ ism.
There is no proof that testing animals at 24 months is fo@@ ol@@ pro@@ of@@ .
There is no need to be an alarm@@ ist.
This gener@@ alisation could not be further from the truth@@ .
Nothing appears in the Min@@ ut@@ es!
Nothing is therefore establish@@ ed@@ ..
Nothing is excluded but at the same time a measured approach is advisable in all the circumstances.
Nothing has been done for far too long@@ !
Nothing is set in st@@ one, and there will of course be more stages to European un@@ ific@@ ation.
Nothing could be less sure.
No@@ thing, however, is perfec@@ t, and the im@@ perfec@@ tions become clear when billi@@ ons of f@@ ile records are stored over long periods of time.
There is nothing more dangerous than the current concentrations of operators who have both the broad@@ casting capacity as well as arch@@ iv@@ es of materi@@ al.
Nothing has been solv@@ ed!
There is no exc@@ use for Ham@@ as roc@@ ket attack@@ s, but nor for the use of den@@ se in@@ ert metal explo@@ si@@ ves to ma@@ im civili@@ ans.
There is nothing to indicate that widespread use of GMOs will result in a reduction in the use of pestic@@ ides.
Therefore, a 20-@@ year old plan can be taken off a shel@@ f, du@@ sted down and it does not need an environmental impact assessment for approv@@ al.

If that is not the case I will communic@@ ate it to the Memb@@ er.
If not, we will be fighting a los@@ ing batt@@ le, and a renew@@ ed increase in the level of the reservo@@ ir would lo@@ om from May 2004 on@@ wards.
If this is not the case, trust will never be established.
If this does not happen, we no longer have a compromis@@ e.
If no such evidence exist@@ s, the fact that 7@@  @@ 200 off@@ ences have been alleg@@ ed cannot be allowed to rest@@ .
If this does not happen, the re@@ med@@ y will be worse than the disease, because people will become resistant to these diseases and that will ultimately work its way through to Western countries as well.
Otherwise, the differences will increas@@ e.
If they do not, we will take this up with them within IC@@ C@@ AT and bil@@ ater@@ ally.
If not, when will it be in oper@@ ation?

Once this first domin@@ o fall@@ s, the rest will follow.
If this happens properly, I do not think that a special European regulatory body will be required.
If this process starts it will not be possible to stop it.
Should it be bann@@ ed, many patients in Europe would lose a highly effective form of treatment.

If certain countries want to use the derog@@ ations, the derog@@ ations should be allowed for their area only and they must be responsible for them.
If it is the case that some fa@@ thers and mothers of young children have to stop work@@ ing, then Europe may well already have missed the bo@@ at.
If certain powers continue to en@@ de@@ av@@ our to give answers to the area with similar vari@@ ations, be they sul@@ t@@ ans or ma@@ har@@ aj@@ as or em@@ irs or pup@@ pe@@ t political prime mini@@ ster@@ s, Europe must not allow it.

If these conditions are not ful@@ fil@@ led, Europe will be an earth@@ en@@ w@@ are po@@ t, and the United States a cast iron one, giving them a defin@@ iti@@ vely domin@@ ant position, and this, like all monopol@@ y situ@@ ations, will be un@@ health@@ y.

If so, how high is it on the agend@@ a?
If that is the case, it should go and get the data.
If this is the case and it becomes ing@@ ra@@ ined and established, however, then it will be necessary to carry out information activities in this area as appropriate.
If this request is made by 32 Memb@@ ers, I can check on the qu@@ or@@ um.

All these aspects should therefore be considered.
All of these centres were supposed to have been properly regul@@ ated.
One single cause under@@ lies all this behaviour@@ , nam@@ ely, the Commission’s bel@@ ie@@ f in itself as the sole pos@@ sess@@ or of a su@@ peri@@ or truth@@ .
All of this is about the survival of the avi@@ ation industry, but aircraft are ham@@ pe@@ red not just by volcan@@ o@@ es, but also by storm@@ s, s@@ now and similar phenomen@@ a.

All of this is a disturb@@ ing indication of how the European Commission sometimes negoti@@ ates.
All of that will fe@@ ature pro@@ min@@ ently in our communic@@ ation, which will be available in the autum@@ n.
All these points are reason enough to call on the Commission to undertake its own comprehensive study.
All this is associated with certain problems - it costs a lot of money.
All of these things are necessary, not just one or two - all of those things are necessary.
All of these people are university gradu@@ ates and are currently perform@@ ing at grade B and A levels but collec@@ ting secret@@ arial pa@@ y.
All of those hop@@ es have been d@@ ash@@ ed.
Each and every one of the stud@@ ents spoke about what a great value it was to them and how it had improved the quality of their lives and that of their commun@@ ity.
All of these events and problems have one common th@@ read@@ : no European country, not even the very big@@ gest@@ , can handle such problems alone.
These are all factors that affect the number of infring@@ ements handled by the Commission and on that basis the increase in the absolute number of cases handled is a positive development rather than something that should cause dis@@ qui@@ et.
All of these factors go to show that this type of development is un@@ sustain@@ able.
Do not all these factors contribute power@@ fully to a potential reduction in ten@@ sion in the Mid@@ dle E@@ ast@@ ?
So all these factors actually led to a number of people think@@ ing: "@@ W@@ ell this E@@ uro 2000 champ@@ ion@@ ship is a soft tou@@ ch.
All of these factors have made production in Europe more expen@@ sive.
All those factors will make using the train more at@@ trac@@ tive.
All this is very serious inde@@ ed, and it must be pointed out const@@ antly.
All this has been documented by international organisations including Amne@@ sty Inter@@ nation@@ al, the United N@@ ations and ad@@ mir@@ able Israeli organisations such as B@@ '@@ T@@ sel@@ em and Ham@@ ok@@ ed, and by Palestinian organisations such as Ad@@ da@@ me@@ er and D@@ ef@@ ence for Children Inter@@ nation@@ al.
All of these groups require particular care and assistance.
Not all of those countries produce sug@@ ar.
All of these countries have strong practical reasons to take a further step.
These and many other points will be tack@@ led in Sant@@ a E@@ ul@@ á@@ li@@ a in the Al@@ gar@@ ve.
Careful external control will have to be exercised on all these points.
These are the points we shall be judg@@ ing you on at the end of the day.
T@@ og@@ e@@ ther, these conditions are responsible for much suffering and many premature deaths.
These are all issues that need to be resolved urg@@ ently.
All these problems and even issues relating to obesity and b@@ ing@@ e drinking have lin@@ ks with a long-@@ hours cul@@ ture.
All of these problems come back, therefore, to the same ca@@ use.
These and other processes that have served to improve the quality and useful@@ ness of the heart val@@ ve should not be constrain@@ ed by the '@@ no@@ t-@@ for@@ -@@ profit@@ ' principle@@ .
These are all pre-@@ processed products derived solely from agricultural products.
All aim to treat malnutrition among children under five years of age, as well as monitoring the health status of women, in particular nursing mothers and pregnant women.
All these reports and all this work is done in a very transparent way.
These are all issues that cause many problems.
All of these them@@ es are closely connec@@ ted.
These different systems sometimes process data collec@@ tions which du@@ plic@@ ate each other and over@@ lap@@ .
Anyone belonging to a different group can be seen as an unwanted competi@@ tor on the job or hous@@ ing market.
Every one of us who has read '@@ Des@@ ert F@@ low@@ er@@ ' by War@@ is Di@@ ri@@ e will always be shoc@@ ked and app@@ all@@ ed by this practice.
All of us with families know that one can travel many mil@@ es, arrive in a car@@ av@@ an site late at night, maybe with fr@@ ac@@ tious children, and certainly not have the energy to go and check out whether the c@@ amp@@ -site is in fact safe.
All those who seek to alter the system fail@@ .
Wh@@ o@@ ever st@@ ays out mis@@ ses out.
It will be clear to any@@ body list@@ ening to this debate just what differences there were between the groups and what a difficult process this has sometimes be@@ en.
All of those who observed that process know that it is a difficult operation and was carried out under time pressure.
Anyone who d@@ read@@ ed the emergence of a centr@@ alis@@ ed, al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty '@@ super@@ stat@@ e' should be more than reas@@ su@@ red.
Anyone who succ@@ um@@ bs to the long-term negative impact of this on their health has to explain themselves in inter@@ views when they return to work after a period of sick leav@@ e, the idea being that illness is a result of personal mis@@ conduc@@ t.
For those who view motor@@ cycle noise from the other side, the non-@@ bi@@ kers who mainly see only the negative aspects of bi@@ k@@ ing, this has been a very difficult deb@@ ate, because when one interest group makes itself heard as l@@ oud@@ ly as those represent@@ ing the heavy bi@@ k@@ ers, it is difficult for Parliament not to side with them.

Any new information which may come to light from the studies or from other sources will be fully considered.
Any other material from an animal which does not fall within the definition of specified risk material is fit for human consumption.
Any other my@@ ster@@ y for which the operation of E@@ uro 11 may be critic@@ ised can only stem from a failure to understand this reality and the information which is actually in the public dom@@ ain.
Any other way of thinking is suic@@ id@@ al.
Any further pre@@ varic@@ ation is point@@ less and de@@ struc@@ tive.
Any possible benefits are far out@@ weighed by the costs.
They say that new bro@@ oms s@@ wee@@ p cle@@ an.
All in all, that does not make for a good day for this form of parliam@@ ent@@ arian@@ ism or for initiatives of this kind.
All good plans and all management plans must include a cat@@ alogue of so@@ ils and an assessment of them, because that is the only way to prevent flood@@ s, to prevent building in stor@@ m dra@@ ins and in H@@ ab@@ it@@ at or Natur@@ a areas.
All of this has been arrang@@ ed so that there is nothing to stand in the way of free servic@@ ing or repa@@ ir@@ s, or the activities of autom@@ ob@@ ile associ@@ ations.
This leads to problems which are not shared equ@@ ally, but it is all regulated nation@@ ally.
All these areas will have to evol@@ ve, and, in many cases, change completely.
All of this needs to happen, and quickly too.
All this must included in the list of measures that can be introduc@@ ed.
All this has to be to the benefit of passeng@@ ers.
All that is already under way.
In fact, their importance is such that they are self-@@ evid@@ ent.
All of this has been fi@@ en@@ dish@@ ly pl@@ ann@@ ed.
All this is also the fruit of your work and your in@@ put@@ .
All that is in progress.
All of this is being done and all of it is necessary.
Is this the proper way to proce@@ ed?
This is very important as long as the rules of the game are clear in terms of quality and discipl@@ ine.
N@@ one of this is possible without the substance of what was agreed in the European Con@@ ven@@ tion, and that substance must be maintain@@ ed, whatever cosme@@ tic surgery you try to effect on the surfac@@ e.
All that is stated in paragraph 40 of the report.
All this is the result of fl@@ agg@@ ing-@@ out, man@@ ning reductions and cheap@@ er labour from third countries.
This is all part of the same issue.
This has all been no@@ ted, Mr Tur@@ co@@ .
All this is fin@@ e; it may not constitute a very direct reaction but nonethel@@ ess provides the background necessary for proper consideration of the issue.
All this is very sen@@ sible.
The resolution explains in great de@@ tail that all this is possible provided that two conditions are u@@ ph@@ el@@ d and satis@@ fied.
All of this is not contradic@@ tor@@ y.
N@@ one of this of ne@@ w.
This is just a ne@@ ver@@ -@@ ending ill@@ u@@ stration of true pro-@@ European schizophren@@ ia.
It is all part of the li@@ e.
The wool is being pul@@ led over our ey@@ es!
That is because he was subjec@@ ted, un@@ like any other Commission@@ er-@@ design@@ ate, to a sa@@ dis@@ tic, pre@@ planned and concer@@ ted attack@@ .
T@@ ak@@ en together these causes give encour@@ agement to less sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ous and crimin@@ ally in@@ clin@@ ed individuals to turn to fra@@ u@@ dul@@ ent activi@@ ties.
All of this will help to breathe life into the Lisbon dre@@ am.
All these things take time.
There is a down@@ side to all of this.
All of which will be under the ‘@@ lead@@ er@@ ship@@ ’ of the so-called ‘@@ European D@@ ef@@ ence Agency@@ ’.
All this is promp@@ ted by the simple logic according to which tobacco causes lung cancer, so all that needs to be done to do away with lung cancer is to stop growing the stuff@@ .
All this has van@@ ished.
This has all dis@@ appeared over the last eight months.
All this has given rise in K@@ in@@ sh@@ as@@ a to a ste@@ ep increase in the market price for maiz@@ e.
It has all been noted very carefully.
All this was a@@ ired recently in the hearing in the Committee on Develop@@ ment, but there were also proposals about what might be done.
T@@ ack@@ ling all of the above at the same time is no easy tas@@ k.
All of this has d@@ ented the original confidence of the public in the will and ability of the Union to protect these fundamental rights un@@ compromis@@ ingly.
This will increase efficiency and quality, to the benefit of both production and consumers.
All this comes at a pr@@ ice.
All of this costs mone@@ y, and so this competition is un@@ fair@@ .
All this is having a negative effect on the people, leading to des@@ pa@@ ir and inc@@ iting re@@ vol@@ t.
All this has negative consequences on the sovereign@@ ty, security and quality of food, and on the environment.
All of which in the name of innov@@ ation@@ !
All for the sa@@ ke of '@@ clar@@ ific@@ ation@@ '.
On top of this we have the back@@ drop of BSE@@ , the traged@@ y of foot@@ -and-@@ mouth, and E@@ .@@ coli s@@ care@@ s.
All this causes delays which naturally lead to fraud@@ .
All this takes time and must not, under any circumstances, be r@@ ush@@ ed.
All this is becoming gro@@ tes@@ qu@@ e!
It is all becoming an issue of blind fa@@ ith@@ .
All that, therefore, now has to be struc@@ k out of the Min@@ utes all over again.
All of this has still to be achieved, through capit@@ alisation and the '@@ prud@@ ent man@@ ' principle@@ .
It should be possible to present and explain all these activities to the public.
It should be abol@@ ish@@ ed!
All of this must be combined with the highest possible levels of safety for consumers in the form of comprehensive animal health services and clear labelling of all food products from animals, in particular, with regard to their origin and the way in which the animals are re@@ are@@ d.
All this is to be done within a period of two weeks.
These must all come under one um@@ brel@@ la@@ .
All this has to be done.
All this needs to be done.
All this has to be put in place to ensure that we get the best possible results for the work that has been undertaken and for the expen@@ se that is in@@ cur@@ red.
All this will have to be "@@ put on the table@@ " and reduced under the G@@ AT@@ T rul@@ es.
All this needs to be tigh@@ tened up.
All of these elements must be app@@ ra@@ ised.
All of this must be included in the Commission study.
All of this results in problems with daily comm@@ ut@@ ing.
That has led to the changes which the Commission is propos@@ ing, in particular Articles 4 and 1@@ 1, where it calls for special attention to be paid to exposure without direct medical advantages for the patient or in the case of potential pregnancy.
This will all lead to an increase in the wav@@ es of refuge@@ es.
All of this leads to dis@@ ill@@ us@@ ion@@ ment with poli@@ tics, pro@@ ving that the market is stronger than democrac@@ y.
All this also has an effect on ac@@ idi@@ fication and e@@ utro@@ ph@@ ic@@ ation.
This is included in the concept of '@@ sustainable develop@@ ment@@ ', but the Commission does not really seem to have accepted this or thought it through y@@ et.
All of that should be brought into consideration.
That is all very mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous@@ !
All this is happening on a daily basis.
All this is to the credit of the Palestini@@ an@@  @@ Author@@ ity.
All of that is very complic@@ ated.
All that can liter@@ ally destroy a brand within a few days or a few weeks.
It is all complete non@@ sense.
All this is totally ill-@@ time@@ d.
And all of these drugs are taken, by more and more youn@@ g@@ ster@@ s.
This is all provided for in the proposed changes.
The whole thing is a sha@@ mb@@ les, blind hypocris@@ y.
All la@@ ud@@ able stuff@@ .
All this has to be b@@ lam@@ ed on the pre-@@ accession process.
Furthermore, the role of women is especially justified because women, who protect life with their maternal inst@@ inc@@ t, are particularly pre@@ disposed to car@@ ing and to preventing conflict through their characteristics of kin@@ d@@ ness, sel@@ fl@@ ess@@ ness, em@@ pathy and comp@@ as@@ sion with other people and their willing@@ ness to help them.
All these things are very n@@ ast@@ y and un@@ pleas@@ ant.
All of this is fal@@ se.
The whole thing is emb@@ arr@@ ass@@ ing.
This is un@@ doub@@ t@@ edly necessary if the dis@@ grac@@ eful@@ , opaque w@@ rang@@ les by Council members in back rooms are finally to be brought to an end.
All very impres@@ si@@ ve@@ !
All of this must be done.
All this is over@@ shado@@ wed by the pir@@ acy r@@ amp@@ ant on the S@@ omal@@ i coast@@ .
All of this is particularly significant when we consider that see@@ king healthcare ab@@ road could be of most benefit to patients who are on long waiting list@@ s, or who cannot find specialist care.
Those are posi@@ tives.
All these things are possible, but they are dependent on Europe extr@@ ic@@ ating itself from stag@@ n@@ ation and bringing about GDP growth of at least several percentage points.
All of this is laugh@@ able.
This is a serious process.
It is all ver@@ y, very depres@@ sing.
They are all very important but ultimately it is about the results.
All of this is very unfortun@@ ate.
All this is highly surpris@@ ing.
It is all very v@@ agu@@ e.
It is a question of finding the right bal@@ ance.
It is all a matter of own@@ er@@ ship.
There has thus been so much negative energy from German@@ y!
This is all part of a process.
It will all end in te@@ ar@@ s.
All of this is dres@@ sed up as a precautionary principal that is nothing more than the regres@@ sive reaction of an A@@ mis@@ h@@ -@@ style European el@@ it@@ e.
Now none of that is left and I will tell you some of the results.
This is all done in d@@ rib@@ s and dr@@ ab@@ s.
All this should not be mis@@ understood as reflec@@ ting a negative at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de.
This merely increases costs and wast@@ es the time of both the authorities and the doctors and nur@@ ses, whose job is to help the sick@@ .
All that would do is to in@@ stitute a domin@@ o effect that would lead to a loss of confidence by the market@@ s.
All this cannot be removed from the European consci@@ ence.
It is not a particularly at@@ tr@@ active development.
All of this, however, can only be achieved or become achiev@@ able if the fac@@ ility really is able to respond rapid@@ ly.
All that does no more good to the environment than it does to the transport system.
All this is not pure ch@@ ance.
N@@ one of this is new in the history of man@@ kind.
All of this must always be seen on the basis of my ce@@ ter@@ um cen@@ se@@ o - there can be no democracy without transparency and a well-@@ used Internet is a ver@@ y, very good way of achieving this.
S@@ cam@@ , sc@@ am, sc@@ am@@ !
All that achiev@@ es is an irrit@@ ated s@@ ne@@ er in Mos@@ co@@ w.
All of this leav@@ es a particularly bad taste in the mouth.
And all bec@@ ause, for the past 14 years and, offici@@ ally, for the past 4 years, there has been a zo@@ on@@ osis, i.e. a disease which can be transmitted from cow@@ s, in this case British cow@@ s, to humans.
All of this because we did not find the EUR @@ 800@@  million that would have made it possible to administer to each African chick@@ en the two necessary vaccin@@ es, at a cost of 40 cents per dose.
The Commission has carried out its own investigations and has described all this itsel@@ f.
All this may be achieved quickly on the lines of the guidelines established by the F@@ if@@ te@@ en.
All of this may sound somewhat gr@@ and.
All this could end up in an incorrect market mechan@@ ism.
All this takes 18 year@@ s; half your life on death row@@ : a cru@@ el life sentence in itsel@@ f. This is not an ab@@ str@@ action.
All of this takes time.
This will take time.
It makes for a sha@@ ky struc@@ ture, a col@@ os@@ sus built on sha@@ ky found@@ ations.
The problems are growing in these areas.
Nevertheless, this requires an examination of the scientific evid@@ ence, the release factors and the exposure situations.
All of that therefore still has to be done.
This is to be carried out in the name of "@@ maintain@@ ing@@ " or "@@ impos@@ ing@@ " peac@@ e, and "@@ humanitarian oper@@ ation@@ s@@ " .
All this is understand@@ able.
It is mis@@ lead@@ ing.
Natur@@ ally all of this will be displayed on your scre@@ en@@ s.
All this will be essential to maintain the mom@@ ent@@ um of the process and to give it the political vig@@ our that it will need to succe@@ ed.
All of this would be odi@@ ous, were it not so gro@@ tes@@ qu@@ e.
This happened in a context where the vaccine manufacturer@@ , despite its he@@ f@@ ty profit@@ s, had the aud@@ ac@@ ity to ref@@ use to take responsibility for the vaccine@@ 's side effects.
All this has also become apparent from the reduction in sick leave and abs@@ ences from work.
This means that Member States may not need@@ less@@ ly require technical or chemical analys@@ es or tests if the same analys@@ es or tests have already been carried out in another Member State and the results are available or may be obtained on demand.
All of these mark good progress for the Union, and you may well conclude that you are left with more than just an over@@ f@@ lowing ash@@ tra@@ y.
All of this will also cause a par@@ adi@@ g@@ m shift in Germany, because Germany will once again be on the side of the small countries, which is important for the identity of this Europe.
This entire group, which on the surface, appears to be quite respec@@ table, oper@@ ated in such a way that it could milk stock market ex@@ ub@@ er@@ ance for their own prof@@ it.
All of that has now completely collap@@ sed.
Everything which enthusias@@ m, energy and char@@ m could do has been done.
All it di@@ d, inde@@ ed, was to demonstrate that in poli@@ tics at least@@ , it is possible to be both heavy and empty at the same time.
All you need to do is give them serious consideration.
All you need to do is sw@@ op Mc@@ C@@ arth@@ y and H@@ at@@ z@@ id@@ ak@@ is with V@@ arel@@ a Su@@ an@@ z@@ es-@@ Car@@ pe@@ gn@@ a and then we can follow on log@@ ic@@ ally.
You can only try to develop the best possible system of trace@@ ability.
'@@ In every@@ thing, do to others what you would have them do to you@@ .'
As a result, everything that has been built up in terms of aid and progress these last 25 years is at risk of being dem@@ ol@@ ished.
The result of all this is a proposal to am@@ end at least 14 direc@@ tives, a number of which have certain problems in common@@ , and it is thus possible to identify them and exam@@ ine them much more system@@ aticall@@ y.
All that was released was a method@@ ology providing for three out@@ comes - the be@@ st, average and worst - and the purpose of the tests was not market transpa@@ rency.
All that glit@@ ters is not g@@ old.
Everything that is a carrier or hand@@ ler or that presents information to a software program which then processes it or that extrac@@ ts the results of the software program@@ 's calcul@@ ations in order to transfer them to the real world via a moving component or a signal – all of this is patent@@ able, while the software program itself is not.
Waste matter must be treated as su@@ ch.
Everything directly related to the service would be considered part of working time@@ ; for example, pap@@ er@@ work, maintenance and general administration.
Everything that is exagg@@ erated is in@@ signific@@ ant.
The horiz@@ on@@ tal side is far har@@ der than the ver@@ tical side.
What@@ ever is needed and more.
Everything possible was done.
Every effort must be made, in particular by the Romani@@ ans, to maintain this mom@@ ent@@ um.
What he has told us here today was actually sc@@ rip@@ ted for him in London.
What it can do is h@@ ire and fire the bos@@ ses.
All that remains to be done is to conver@@ t this commit@@ ment into concrete actions whose effects can be measure@@ d, because it is the results that matter.
A longer sentence was suppres@@ sed and all that remains is '@@ propos@@ es that the Commission should check if existing sites in protected areas have been extended and if some of them are in Natur@@ a 2000 protected sit@@ es'.
All they did was delay it.
They just want the chain - where the product comes from and where it really origin@@ ates from - to be fully trace@@ able.
An enti@@ ty that does not have a name and has not been defined has no identi@@ ty, and as such that enti@@ ty is considered non-@@ exist@@ ent.
Any@@ thing which does not fall within this must be made public via the Min@@ ut@@ es.
Everything that can be done to improve the situation should be done.
Everything that can be done must be done to alleviate this human suffer@@ ing.
Any@@ thing that can be better regulated at national level should continue to be done at national level.
Everything from the Con@@ stitution should be excluded.
Any@@ thing that happens to a child in this context is ru@@ th@@ less.
Everything which is already on the market now, which you can see in any air@@ por@@ t, from E@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ eth Ar@@ den to El@@ len Bet@@ ri@@ x, all of this can continue to be sold and marketed.
Any talk of dec@@ on@@ struction of the European project is ir@@ responsib@@ le.
This entire system needs revis@@ ing.
All this growth is due to immigr@@ ation and bir@@ ths to immigr@@ ants.
All this work was dis@@ missed as non@@ sense.
All that work, except the EC@@ HO dimen@@ sion, will be put through the Agency over the next couple of months.
All this work is taking place.
The journe@@ y has not been without its difficulties and shock@@ s.
Any changes must be made gradually and according to progress in the European A@@ rea of J@@ us@@ tice and the development of technology.
Any possible change to these rules must be fair and equal to all particip@@ ants.
Any change should be aimed at facilit@@ ating the Colleg@@ e@@ ’s decision-@@ making process.
Any policy change in this field may affect rights already granted to users of certain design@@ ations.
Any change would require unanim@@ ity.
Every citiz@@ en and worker in the EU may be under preventive surveillance and recorded as data.
All cloning is by definition re@@ produc@@ tive.
Just as with dist@@ anc@@ e-@@ sell@@ ing, the initial im@@ pet@@ us has been given to measures on the treatment of cross-border complain@@ ts.
Like many other hundreds of volunte@@ ers, she had seen the de@@ struc@@ tion, was@@ hed birds and clean@@ ed up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those even@@ ings and nigh@@ ts when they really should have been required to be there.
As in 2005, approximately one third of these peti@@ tions were not within the sp@@ here of compe@@ tence of the European Union and were therefore de@@ emed in@@ ad@@ mis@@ sible.
The European Union's log@@ o is also pain@@ ted on the two L@@ and R@@ over@@ s.
As has An@@ gol@@ a, until recently the sc@@ ene of Afric@@ a's Thir@@ ty Y@@ ear@@ s' War@@ .'
Fin@@ ding solutions and compromis@@ es to what were - or appeared to be - intr@@ act@@ able problems suddenly ar@@ ose like the cream rising to the top of milk.
It is also significant that Rec@@ it@@ als R and S state that measures must have restrictions on the part of States so that there is no abuse of the legal regul@@ ations.
As is the case with the driving lic@@ ence, the par@@ king card will remain a national or regional card but with the Community model design@@ .
One example of this is the recruit@@ ment of over-@@ qualified people for less high-@@ powered job@@ s.
Like wood products, paper products are also under pressure from substitutes such as plas@@ tic, glass and metal@@ s.
Also, some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in Engl@@ ish, that is quite a meaning@@ less term.
Like ma@@ them@@ atic@@ al the@@ ories and the very process of though@@ t, software cannot be patent@@ ed.
As in the story about the half-@@ cup of water, some will see it as half full and some as half emp@@ ty.
No more than the Sha@@ h@@ 's police state, the ru@@ ins of which have been used by the A@@ y@@ at@@ ol@@ la@@ h@@ s to establish their mur@@ der@@ ous state, was a democrac@@ y.
Like me, they recognised that it is compar@@ atively early days.
Like me, Mrs @@ G@@ om@@ es saw elderly people qu@@ eu@@ ing up for hours on end without food or water and then casting their votes with broad gr@@ ins.

Any trade in cells or human organs would turn human beings into objec@@ ts, and women@@ ’s wom@@ bs into inc@@ ub@@ ators.

It all f@@ its together.
It all combin@@ es to cause an out@@ break of the illness when these conditions enc@@ oun@@ ter an hereditary pre@@ disp@@ osition to the ill@@ ness.
Com@@ plac@@ ency will lead to gri@@ d@@ loc@@ k.
On the one hand, the demand is made in it@@ em 3 that we should take note of the Commission proposal and regard the present list as complete, and the view is expres@@ sed that further her@@ b@@ s, sp@@ ices and seas@@ on@@ ings derived from plants should be allowed to be ir@@ radi@@ ated in the EU only if this is scientific@@ ally recognised as being harm@@ less and effici@@ ent.
Firstly, it does not apply to bul@@ l bar@@ s in the after@@ market, that is to say those that are fitted subsequently to car@@ s.

First, is it true that the digital tach@@ ograp@@ h, 1@@ B in the docum@@ ents, is clearly better in this respect than the improved conventional tach@@ ograp@@ h 1A@@ ?
Firstly, it has always been recommended that resources and mechanisms should be made available by the European Union and its Commission to support Al@@ mad@@ é@@ n in restructuring its activity, so that the people will not suffer as a result of the closure of their traditional min@@ ing industry.
Firstly, there should be a target from 2010 on@@ wards and then a limit from 20@@ 15 on@@ wards of 25 micrograms per cub@@ ic me@@ ter.
A first point is, we thin@@ k, the fact that it has become clear with the passage of time, and there are interesting studies in the United States showing that, that there is a good deal of time between being infected with HIV and the onset of the disease and that there are actually a number of additional fact@@ ors, weak@@ ening of the immune system and the lik@@ e, which lead directly to a more rapid onset of the disease than others.
First, it is almost certain that the reported and investigated cases are only the tip of the ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ .

First, the new tests which would improve or possibly even replace recommended method@@ s, such as combin@@ ing the pa@@ p test with testing for infection with high-@@ risk human pap@@ ill@@ oma viruses or in other words, H@@ PV test@@ ing, and, secon@@ d, the new tests for cancers in other organ@@ s, such as P@@ SA testing for pro@@ state cancer.
To begin with, the impact of these problems of excessive radioactive contamination is felt in health term@@ s, particularly through an increase in cases of cancer and other health problems.
For a star@@ t, the impact of the use of bi@@ omet@@ ric data in such a large system has not been ass@@ es@@ sed, and nor have the conditions for the inclusion of such data been adequately laid down.
The first is the insul@@ ation of cab@@ les in the cock@@ p@@ it area with Kap@@ ton, the insul@@ ating material made from M@@ yl@@ ar and T@@ ed@@ l@@ ar, and the aircraf@@ t's inter@@ active audi@@ o-@@ vide@@ o system.

Firstly, antibiotic@@ -resistant genes must be ph@@ ased out.
Well@@ , first of all, there must be a reduction in total use, at the same time as substitute materials are promot@@ ed.
Firstly, because bul@@ ls do not fight each other@@ ; it is not an animal fighting another animal@@ ; it is a very no@@ ble fight by a man against a bul@@ l, and sometimes it is the man who di@@ es, or is often woun@@ ded.
First, that the values agreed on fresh water protection are completely un@@ clear@@ : the parameters have been so tam@@ pe@@ red with by statistical changes that the degree of protection they will provide is extremely du@@ bi@@ ous.

Everything about that tragic event - from the migrants on a rubber bo@@ at on the high se@@ as, to the people smuggl@@ ers who put them there and the authorities who j@@ ail@@ ed their res@@ cu@@ ers - is test@@ am@@ ent to the failure of Europe's approach to migr@@ ation.
All the sa@@ me, the problem does exist and it is of particular concern that the number of children living in poverty is much greater than the number of adults.

This line of reason@@ ing, which appears to be common to the different groups, is extremely interest@@ ing!
From a very young age our children suffer discrimination that traum@@ atis@@ es them, and they carry the burden of this discrimination for the rest of their lives.
Such are the multi@@ t@@ ude of lob@@ bi@@ es which are mil@@ ling around the issue.
If they will be so very small, why not none at all@@ ?

There are three conditions to be met.
There are three possible explan@@ ations: either the Commission gave OL@@ AF@@ ’s director completely fat@@ u@@ ous instruc@@ tions, with the result that he did not keep the Commission in@@ forme@@ d; or the Commission w@@ ished to leave un@@ pleas@@ ant matters on the back bur@@ ner for years in a secre@@ tive OL@@ AF@@ ; or OL@@ AF@@ ’s management is app@@ all@@ ingly naive and does not understand the political necessity of soun@@ ding the al@@ arm b@@ ell@@ s so that the Commission is warned of serious fraud@@ .

Three hours later, the shop no longer exist@@ ed.
Three men, three Greek employe@@ es, finally obtained payment of their w@@ ages, but only after three weeks of hung@@ er stri@@ ke.
Thirdly, the last mat@@ ter, and one which is very important, is that of the anti-@@ mis@@ s@@ ile shiel@@ d.
The third and last issue – that of economy – is that, despite having more functions and more us@@ ers, the system must be more hom@@ ogen@@ e@@ ous, more flex@@ ible, more secure and per@@ form better.

Thirdly, a model of evol@@ ving action has been developed - according to the weather forecast@@ , the evol@@ ution and activity of the volcan@@ o can change from hour to hour - but who is going to continue to carry out an up@@ -to-@@ date assessment of the safety of air cor@@ rid@@ or@@ s?
Thirdly, to alleviate the shock caused by g@@ rubb@@ ing-@@ up, there must be an increase in plant@@ ing, which can start with the 3 % which is being deb@@ ated.

Thirdly, low@@ er-@@ noise procedu@@ res, which allow pil@@ ots to limit noise at the time of tak@@ e-@@ off and land@@ ing.
Third@@ ly there is market domin@@ anc@@ e: E@@ .@@ ON currently controls 60@@ -@@ 70% of the German market while Ga@@ z de France has a 70@@ -8@@ 0% share of the French market and there are no mechanisms in place to do anything about this.

thir@@ d@@ ly, it is important to increase retro@@ actively and until the end of the transitional period the amount of aid given to mil@@ ls for partial abandon@@ ment of production.
Thir@@ d, more specific re@@ marks need to be made regarding lines B@@ 3-@@ 30@@ 1 and B@@ 3-@@ 30@@ 9.

Thirdly, the he@@ at@@ wa@@ ve has shown that elec@@ tricit@@ y-@@ producing st@@ ations, extremely centralised as they are, were in danger of no longer being able to produce electricity if the ri@@ vers no longer had enough water or were too hot@@ .
Thirdly, the Commission will shor@@ tly adopt a decision requiring all off@@ al from mam@@ m@@ als to be treated using processes which ensure that the organis@@ ms causing scrap@@ ie and BSE are demonstr@@ ably ren@@ dered inactive.

Thir@@ d, the addition of cel@@ ery and mu@@ st@@ ard and their derived products to the list of aller@@ genic substances.
Thirdly, the area of entrepre@@ neur@@ ship.
Thirdly, genetic engine@@ ering is achiev@@ ing, in a very short period, even better results than plant breed@@ ers could achieve through conventional propag@@ ation and crossing methods over years of trials, thus enhancing food values, proteins, star@@ ches, oil contents and yiel@@ ds and, most important@@ ly, off@@ ering the prospec@@ t of better uptake of soil nutri@@ ents, thus requiring less ferti@@ li@@ z@@ er.
Third@@ ly: multi@@ lingu@@ alism.
Thirdly, the de minim@@ is level should be increased to 50 000 hec@@ tol@@ it@@ res, for example.

Thirdly, the risks attached to such instruments are potentially large because of their le@@ ver@@ age effects.
The third and most important point is that the penal@@ ties for those who break the rules have been increased to a fine of € 14 000, two years imprison@@ ment and the permanent conf@@ isc@@ ation of hun@@ ting lic@@ ences for repeat off@@ en@@ der@@ s; in other words, the second time round they are shown the red flag and sent off.

Th@@ re@@ e, do you know of any plans and time sche@@ dul@@ es to ref@@ lo@@ at the vessel - to which you referred just now - or of any plans to monitor the risk of contamination being released from its car@@ go@@ ?
Thirdly, if the genetically modified organ@@ ism is a plant being cultiv@@ ated experim@@ entally and commerci@@ ally, similar but un@@ modified plants should be protec@@ ted. Th@@ is, because transf@@ ers of pol@@ len may take place, when as is quite natur@@ al, new vari@@ eties of the same plant will emerg@@ e which, however, may have different and perhaps undesirable proper@@ ties.
Thirdly, either contamination cros@@ sed over to the meal fed to poul@@ try, or there is a third transmission rout@@ e.

Thirdly, a technical tool - a conver@@ ter - will be made available during this interim period that will connec@@ t the S@@ IS I central system to the S@@ IS II central system, enab@@ ling both to process the same information and ensuring that all Member States stay on the same level.
The third element is the key role for ES@@ MA envisaged in this provis@@ ion, which will make the supervision of manag@@ ers more consistent and will enhance the functioning of European and thir@@ d-@@ country passp@@ or@@ ts.
Thirdly, there should be equal numbers of male and female particip@@ ants.
Thirdly, there are shoc@@ ks caused by the collapse of demand for a good or service in which a country speci@@ alis@@ es.
Thirdly, given the reported failure of both black box@@ es in the final minutes of the Sw@@ is@@ s air flight that recently cr@@ as@@ hed off the coast of Can@@ ad@@ a, will the Commission ensure that the black box@@ es in all fer@@ ries are fitted with aux@@ iliary power suppli@@ es?

Another point of the agreement regards the development of an EMEA centralised procedure for the marketing authorisation of new medicinal products.
Another important point is the question of the pestic@@ idal pain@@ t.
Another aspect which is important is what capacity is to elimin@@ ated.
An additional important aspect is that cross-border healthcare also has great significance in cases where the appropriate level of treatment for a certain disease is not available in one Member State but is available in another.
Another negative aspect is the promotion of inciner@@ ators over a certain efficiency from disposal plant to recovery pl@@ ant.
Another positive aspect is the creation of a Committee for Her@@ bal Medicinal Products at last@@ .

Another area where the school@@ teach@@ er would rap the Council over the k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ les is the European pat@@ ent.
Another important effect for the European Union - which has not been mentioned and is in@@ direc@@ t, but very important - is its reperc@@ ussions for the enlargement process.
Another important matter is the significant differences in cancer treatment success rates between the old and new Member States.
Another important element will be the Stockholm Fol@@ low@@ -up Grou@@ p.
A ver@@ ification procedure is also required which is more clearly defined than the one established in Copenha@@ gen@@ .
Another particularly important element is the equal weigh@@ ting given to produc@@ er@@ s’ own consumption of c@@ ogen@@ erated electricity and electricity fed into the gri@@ d, and therefore to mechanical and other plants which do not feed into the gri@@ d.
Another valu@@ able part of the report is that it promotes the definition of protection areas for aqu@@ if@@ ers which supply medicinal water sourc@@ es.

The second example is an organisation with a number of staff which has been receiving subsidies for several years.
Another factor contrib@@ uting to the water problem in Ireland is the waste eff@@ lu@@ ent from fact@@ ories like A@@ ugh@@ in@@ ish Al@@ um@@ ina, Coun@@ ty Lim@@ er@@ ick@@ , which has been a major source of pollution to the local and surrounding area with its toxic red mu@@ d depos@@ its le@@ aking into the water sup@@ ply.
Another negative factor is the lack of information and lack of motiv@@ ation: according to general opinion, education later in life is not valued enough and not re@@ war@@ ded enough.
Another factor taken into account in assessing market power on the purchas@@ ing market is the possible ver@@ tical integration into production on the part of a re@@ tail chain or its strategic use of own br@@ and@@ s.
Another factor which is also just as important is for trad@@ ers not to have to adap@@ t to different requirements.
Another factor which is just as important is for SOL@@ V@@ IT staff to be able to receive legal assist@@ ance, both from officials working in public administr@@ ations and from the European Commission, given the degree of complex@@ ity of the cases which are being reported to SOL@@ VI@@ T.
There is also something else that causes me concern.

Another European country to become a member is Bos@@ n@@ ia@@ -@@ Her@@ ce@@ g@@ ov@@ in@@ a.
Another ‘@@ pl@@ us@@ ’ is that we have taken quite deliber@@ ate account in the programme of the expan@@ sion of M@@ arc@@ o Pol@@ o I in response to new and changing circumstances.
Another vital point is the incen@@ tiv@@ es@@ /@@ responsibil@@ ity, incen@@ tiv@@ es@@ /@@ prescrip@@ tions mechan@@ ism.
Another thing that is common to all the money used is that there are rules that must be followed, and if those rules are not followed, a penal@@ ty must be pa@@ id.
Another point is the need to reduce labour market seg@@ mentation in line with the common flex@@ ic@@ urity polici@@ es.
Another point is the b@@ ans on substances.
Another point of controver@@ sy concerned the responsible pers@@ on.
Another area which is open to criticism is the combination of distance and door@@ -to-@@ door sal@@ es, because it is much easier for people to be taken un@@ awa@@ res on their own front door@@ step.
Another difficult point is identi@@ fying the areas in which the checks should be carried out.
Another point is the whole area of provis@@ ion.
Furthermore, the enlargement to 25 Member States has increased the burden on the ag@@ encies, yet they have not been given the necessary resources to be able to function effectively.

Another important point (A@@ mend@@ ments Nos 4 and 9) makes it compulsory for operators to obtain in@@ surance cover for the contained use of G@@ MM@@ s.
A further important point is the improvement of rules to prevent possible suff@@ oc@@ ation, clar@@ ification of the essential safety requirements and, totally ne@@ w, rules for toys in swe@@ ets.
Another important point is the principle of region@@ alisation.
Another important point is the special and differen@@ tial treatment of the developing countries.
Another point is that waste should not be incin@@ erated or crushed, not only in the case of lead@@ , cadmium and mercur@@ y, but also in the case of waste which contains PV@@ C.
Another important point on which you agree with the Commission's proposal regards the budget@@ , which is based on the average support granted over the period 2000@@ -@@ 2002, and a marg@@ inal as@@ surance has been added to take into account the vari@@ ability of the ban@@ ana market.
Another point concerning Article 7@@ (1) is veterinary use.
A further positive is that we are oblig@@ ing the manufacturers to ensure that if there is a battery in an appli@@ ance it must be easy to remov@@ e.
Another point which was made by some of you was@@ : what is the level of ambi@@ tion?
Another area where I have serious questions is the growing movement towards assessing all small children for mental health problems and medic@@ ating appropri@@ ately.
Another specific point concerns the use of lef@@ to@@ vers from large restaur@@ ants and cat@@ ering establish@@ ments.
Of equal importance with these points is the protection of small and medium-sized poultry unit@@ s, which have sustained a serious blo@@ w from avian influenz@@ a, and the proper application of the provisions of Community law relating to safety in the work@@ place, especially for high-@@ risk groups consist@@ ing of workers in close and constant contact with bir@@ ds.
Another very interesting point addressed by the rapporteur is that of the psychological treatment of multiple sclerosis, a disease which, because it generally affects young people at what should be the most productive time of their lives, causes them to face an uncertain future, both from the social and the professional points of view.
Another fundamental principle of this directive is that of an@@ on@@ y@@ mit@@ y, which must be compatible with the trace@@ ability of the tissues and cells.
Another problem is that though the nutritional profiles that will be required by law on all products will be a step in the right direction they will fail to distingu@@ ish the quality of the fat, sugar and salt in the food or drin@@ k.
Another related issue is the aspect of regulation and supervision.
Another matter relates to what are known as '@@ orphan book@@ s', in other words, works for which it has not been possible to identify the cop@@ y@@ right own@@ er.
There is one further problem in particular, namely the growing tendency to separate information from com@@ ment@@ ary.
Another problem is the absence of special physical education class@@ es for overweight or obese young people.
Another problem is the ap@@ pen@@ di@@ x which states which vitamins and minerals are to be permitted as food supplement@@ s.
Another problem is that work done by women, such as house@@ work, bringing up children or car@@ ing for rel@@ atives, is often not regarded as proper work.
An additional problem is that hours on call for fire figh@@ ters and medical staff are often not included in their working hours.

One of the principles that comes out of the report is recogn@@ is@@ ing, as a starting point for any analysis, the multiple causes and forms of this type of crime that ex@@ ist.
One of the problems with organic food is the difficulty of testing it to see how it has been produced.
One of the greatest problems will always be the cost fact@@ or.
One of the problems we have at the moment is that this lif@@ eline - if I can use that an@@ alog@@ y - is sometimes rather long and at other times rather shor@@ t, according to the fluctuations in the mon@@ etary market.
One of the problems is posed by don@@ ations.
One of the problems at the beginning was transport and how to reach a population where the bridg@@ es had all collap@@ sed and there were no road@@ s.
One of the most important findings was that, according to r@@ ating procedu@@ res, banks required up to 400@@ % more deposit for vent@@ ure financing and star@@ t-@@ up@@ s.
One of the ro@@ les of the in@@ stitute will be to eliminate gender ste@@ re@@ oty@@ pes by dissemin@@ ating information on non-@@ ste@@ re@@ oty@@ p@@ ical male and female rol@@ es, together with providing li@@ b@@ eral examples to follow.
A destroy@@ er, a disrup@@ ter?
A de@@ tail can be an@@ ody@@ ne, but it can also be essenti@@ al.
A second appe@@ al.
There is also a second reason why prud@@ ence is needed in the regulation of these undertak@@ ings.
A second aspect would also be to have joint programm@@ ing.
A second aspect of the Regulation was fron@@ tal protection systems.
A second in@@ comprehen@@ sible aspect of this agreement is the 3% margin which you have de@@ man@@ ded@@ ...
A second aspec@@ t, and an important one, is the use of nam@@ es. It is of im@@ men@@ se importance to any cre@@ ative arti@@ st that he should be able to put his name to his work, even if he is a mere c@@ og@@ , a part of the who@@ le.
The second important point is that there are sudden epide@@ mic@@ s of new diseases.
A second important el@@ ement, a second chap@@ ter, if you lik@@ e, is the procedure for in@@ stit@@ uting flight ban@@ s.
A second very concrete example is that of the health school in Vien@@ n@@ a, which trains African research@@ ers in the method@@ ology of clinical trials.
Then a second point of commun@@ ality.
Another weak point in your proposals is that you are bas@@ ing your comments on Article 3@@ 1.
A second central problem that has emerg@@ ed is the olig@@ opol@@ isation of this market.
A second problem about which there is too little talk is the overall loss of competitiv@@ eness and the ever-@@ wid@@ ening competition divide between the North and the Sou@@ th.
A second research project has been commis@@ sion@@ ed.
An analy@@ tically discipl@@ ined extension of the second pill@@ ar is also needed.
un@@ equal development is in@@ he@@ rent in the capit@@ alist method of production, because the incen@@ tive for any development process is the maxim@@ isation of capit@@ al@@ ;
This growth will help the regions to help themselves and to create their own future, without the need to continu@@ ously strug@@ gle to keep up with the others.
Technolog@@ ical development is therefore needed.
Adequate diagnosis is necessary.
E@@ arly diagnosis and treatment could reduce this figure significantly.
The early diagnosis of tuberculosis and the tho@@ rough and ful@@ ly-@@ monitored treatment of the disease, in other words, treatment that is un@@ interrupted and of sufficient dur@@ ation, are the basic pre-@@ conditions for reducing the risk of extensive treatment resistance and multi-@@ resistant forms of T@@ BC develop@@ ing, the treatment of which is extremely expensive and difficult to obtain in many countries.
E@@ arly diagnos@@ is, free scre@@ en@@ ings for risk groups and, above all, making the population better informed have a key part to play in this, since Alzheimer's is generally identified at too late a stage in the EU.
When a dialogue at this level and with these procedures is only held twice a year, it is not possible for it to provide all the answers to such questions.
A dialogue must be mut@@ u@@ al.
- greater inter@@ cultural dialogu@@ e;
In F@@ lan@@ ders, we have a saying ‘@@ de gi@@ er@@ ig@@ he@@ id be@@ dri@@ eg@@ t de w@@ ij@@ she@@ id@@ ’ – pen@@ n@@ y-@@ wise, p@@ oun@@ d-@@ fo@@ ol@@ ish.
There is a saying in Irish that "@@ its lack of use is to its de@@ trim@@ ent@@ ”.
It is a difficult tigh@@ tro@@ pe@@ .
An Ox@@ ford degree in psych@@ ology should be recognised every@@ where, and the same should apply to a psych@@ ology degree a@@ war@@ ded by a less pres@@ ti@@ gious university in a smaller country.
A university dipl@@ om@@ a?
There is a tri@@ ple@@ -@@ lock safety net there to make sure that this cannot happen@@ .
D@@ iv@@ or@@ ce is always a traum@@ atic experience for a child, as it is for adults too, and if it is followed by li@@ tig@@ ation that last@@ s for years it can become absolutely intoler@@ able.
A paper was submitted to IC@@ ES in 2005, but IC@@ ES has not considered this paper or issued an opin@@ ion.
A document has been submitted to Parliament setting out the Commission’s position on each of the amend@@ ment@@ s@@ (@@ 1).
A 35@@ -@@ page document that remov@@ es the most difficult items is not a successful document@@ : it is a document that dro@@ wn@@ s its difficulties in a sea of p@@ ages.
An options paper will be issued in the coming days and it will be discussed by the An@@ tic@@ i Group before a discussion in CO@@ RE@@ PE@@ R II.
I would like to quote from a Commission document about how to avoid or minimise new trade disput@@ es.
There is an internal Council document which was to be discus@@ sed.
A private document involving a not@@ ary public may be recognised as expres@@ sing the will of the parti@@ es.
The ne@@ gl@@ ec@@ t of one potential source of water has been crimin@@ al: the conversion of salt water into industrial and process water.
A European research area should certainly include:
A European T@@ LD@@ , therefore, should be sy@@ non@@ ym@@ ous with a zone of e-@@ confid@@ ence.
One area which has been drawn to my attention in the last few days is the right for claims to lap@@ se after four years.
One area that has not been regulated concerns the behaviour of Memb@@ ers.
A serv@@ ant of the g@@ od D@@ ion@@ y@@ sus st@@ ole wine to give it to humans for the first time.
The conditions of competition must be fair@@ .
A du@@ opol@@ y will always be un@@ st@@ able.
A lack of eff@@ or@@ t, however, can lead to disast@@ er.
L@@ ast@@ ly, there were no veterinary inspec@@ tions.
Concer@@ ted action is required as the non-@@ involvement of a single ri@@ par@@ ian state may result in the whole process being block@@ ed.
But effici@@ ent, perform@@ anc@@ e-@@ ori@@ ented action is only possible if these guidelines reflect an assessment of results achieved.
Effective and cohe@@ rent action against these diseases should therefore offer different solutions depending on the case, but also comb@@ ine measures on several levels.
European action in this area was necessary.
A military operation is never an act of re@@ tal@@ i@@ ation, but must always lead to greater sec@@ urity.
Prepar@@ atory action can be small but can be big@@ g@@ er.
Rapid action has been the order of the day since this path@@ ogen emerg@@ ed.
Str@@ uc@@ tural action must be taken with clear and stable rules guarante@@ eing that the system will be rob@@ ust@@ .
The first is strong enough action.
This directive would also need to be updated with regard to the types of company it covers and with regard to its references to accounting requirements.
Some updat@@ ing is needed.
The possibility of being ready in 2007 has not been lo@@ st, but it will require plenty of work from both countries.
E@@ ffici@@ ent administration cannot allow this ine@@ quality.
An un@@ w@@ iel@@ d@@ y and cost@@ ly administration reduces that effectiven@@ ess.
One out of every two teen@@ age girls from an under@@ privileg@@ ed background shows a high level of psychological dist@@ res@@ s.
In the last few days, however, a story has come to light that clearly needs to be brought up here because of its pec@@ ul@@ i@@ ar@@ ities.
There has been a case of this nature in the UK, and there has also been a recent case in Ital@@ y.
There is a similar case going on in Belgium over Char@@ ler@@ o@@ i.
An Africa that is at eas@@ e, cour@@ ted by multiple partners off@@ ering for the first time, and indeed the first time in a long while, promis@@ ing perspec@@ tives for growth, will clearly wish to be treated as an equ@@ al.
A strong and efficient agency will provide as@@ sur@@ ances that products will not be placed on the market without the necessary precautions being taken.
A deep@@ ening of the existing crisis could lead to the growth of un@@ rest and anti-@@ democratic feel@@ ing.
A@@ gricul@@ ture that is closer to nature must be the norm@@ , not the excep@@ tion.
Gre@@ ater assistance for the Man@@ aging Author@@ ities from the Commission would contribute to reducing the mistak@@ es made in the past at the first level of controls.
Food aid is also included.
Adequate income support.
Community and national aid must be given at once.
Co@@ ord@@ inated aid should be sent as a matter of urg@@ ency, but it should be done without giving in to ne@@ o-@@ colon@@ i@@ alist temp@@ t@@ ations.
State aid can be provided only for the development of ne@@ w, innovative products.
Em@@ erg@@ ency assistance is needed at once in order to combat diseases effectively and combat hung@@ er.
It is delivered to vulnerable groups and populations according to need and where access and security conditions permit@@ .
Hel@@ p is available from the European level to develop these skills and thereby help make individuals more employ@@ able.
Ex@@ traordinary and exceptional help should be considered in these precise cases.
Ex@@ traordinary and exceptional help should be conside@@ red, strictly in these cases.
financial support to take old soft fruit and ch@@ er@@ ry plant@@ ations out of production in the event of prolonged supply sur@@ pl@@ us@@ es.
In@@ sufficient aid is guaranteed not to produce results.
Po@@ or@@ ly organised assistance can lead to depend@@ ence or, as some people say, the moder@@ n@@ isation of depend@@ ence.
Prac@@ tical help can@@ , however, ease some of the mis@@ er@@ y.
Oper@@ ating aid can only be authorised if it is likely to have positive effects.
A@@ id of up to EUR 3@@  000 per farmer may be granted for three years without noti@@ fying the Commission, provided that, among other pre@@ conditions, the upper limit applicable to Spain is not exce@@ e@@ ded.
- public aid for fle@@ et reno@@ vation should be available until the end of 2006 instead of December 200@@ 4@@ ;
Further scientific support will be necessary in order to analyse the effects of this new legislation.
Would any aid be required and what is the Commission's opinion on Turk@@ ey@@ 's ac@@ tion?
If there were a crisis in a neighbour@@ ing country, it would be possible to agree another EUR 3 million for that purpos@@ e, too.
Special assistance was given to the Mun@@ ic@@ ip@@ al Corpor@@ ation of B@@ hop@@ al for the preparation of an urban reproductive and child health pl@@ an.
For Mon@@ ten@@ e@@ gro@@ , additional aid of EUR 20 million is to be provided.
Additional aid is required for developing countries.
Bal@@ anced nutrition is especially important for children, and here milk and milk products have a major part to pla@@ y.
Medic@@ ated feed or feed containing pre-@@ mixed antibiotic additives have one very definitive purpose on large unit@@ s: to treat sick animals.
Health@@ y food and sufficient physical exercise help prevent obes@@ ity.
A claim should be scientific@@ ally substanti@@ ated by taking into account the tot@@ ality of the scientific data available, and by weighing up the evid@@ ence.
A cov@@ en@@ ant is made open-@@ en@@ ded@@ ly by two or more parties who come together in a bond of loy@@ al@@ ty and trust to achieve together what none can achieve alone.
A mon@@ st@@ rous alli@@ ance was formed in both cases, one by the Americ@@ ans, the other by the Russi@@ ans, which means that, in a bid to control a particular group of Islamic fundament@@ al@@ ists, agreements are concluded with other Islamic fundament@@ al@@ ists.
A cov@@ en@@ ant is not a contr@@ act.
There will be deterioration in the quality, of course, but also in the flavour@@ , and the goods are clearly not what they are represented as be@@ ing.
A quota management system such as that existing in New Ze@@ al@@ and since 198@@ 6 is one possible altern@@ ative.
An alternative pro@@ position is that we start half an hour earlier at 8.@@ 30 and then have the voting time at 11 o@@ ' c@@ loc@@ k.
We need an increase in quality and reli@@ ability, and market discipl@@ ine is then the best incen@@ tive.
Bet@@ ter marketing and awaren@@ ess@@ -@@ raising measures are required to increase the consumption of organic products.
Improvement is therefore necessary, and we are also improving the protection of priv@@ acy and sec@@ ur@@ ity, as in the case of j@@ un@@ k ma@@ il.
If the effects of substances are to be examined properly better information on their properties will be needed.
There needs to be a tho@@ rough analysis of the economic benef@@ it.
A cost-@@ benefits analysis is, therefore, fundament@@ al.
An analysis of the economy of culture in Europe was spon@@ so@@ red by the Commission and important data has emerg@@ ed.
Res@@ i@@ due test@@ ing, pr@@ e mor@@ tem@@ , through urine and blood sampl@@ es, and post mor@@ tem@@ , through kidney and meat sampl@@ ing, must be carried out by the competent veterinary authorities to ensure maximum food safety.
Detailed analysis and argum@@ entation on this matter can be foun@@ d, for example, in the Commission's EM@@ U@@ @@@ 10 report of 2008.
An independent review of the NE@@ AF@@ C@@ 's performance was positive over@@ all, something which is not always the case for R@@ F@@ M@@ Os.
Is any analysis or market research available on how well informed people are about this Re@@ form Treat@@ y, both quantit@@ atively and qual@@ it@@ ati@@ vel@@ y?
A preliminary internal analysis shows positive outcomes.
The statistics cap@@ ture this very well@@ : in this field alone, up to 6 % of jobs will disappear. In the cataly@@ tic conver@@ ter industry, 15 000 new posts have been cre@@ ated.
A separate analysis of the data carried out on be@@ half of the European Commission is now available on the Euro@@ pa website and I will ensure that a copy is made available to the honour@@ able Memb@@ er.
Specific analysis in this field will be able to indicate the best way to use existing legisl@@ ation, such as REAC@@ H.
A campaign@@ -free year@@ : what a relief that will be.
A credi@@ ble application of the centralised procedure for marketing medicinal products cannot work without this sort of approach.
However, excessive use or defec@@ tive environmental charges risk having the opposite effect.
Str@@ ic@@ t application of the N@@ +@@ 2 rule is necessary, otherwise the reservo@@ ir of commit@@ ments will en@@ dure artific@@ i@@ ally. G@@ iv@@ en enlargement this cannot occur.
A strict implementation of the Scientific Committee recommendations would require removal of vertebral column in animals aged over twelve months, as is currently the case in France.
A joint approach on issues like health could ensure a longer life, with proper care and medic@@ ation, all while reducing costs.
Taking a gradual approach on the basis of a bal@@ anced check@@ -@@ list will help identify any tendency to over-@@ regul@@ ate at an early stage and give the legis@@ lat@@ or adequate warn@@ ing.
A sector@@ i@@ al, discipl@@ ine-@@ based approach is on occas@@ ion a temp@@ ting one.
Excessive private appropri@@ ation of this tool is, therefore, dangerous. Cop@@ y@@ right is more suit@@ able.
A gun like this trag@@ ically killed a 12-@@ year-old Man@@ ch@@ est@@ er gir@@ l, K@@ am@@ il@@ a@@ h Pen@@ ist@@ on.
There is still a re@@ arg@@ u@@ ard of men who are opposed to this.
Community assistance for U@@ g@@ anda and Gu@@ y@@ ana was delivered in mid-@@ 1998 and early 2000, amoun@@ ting to EUR 4.@@ 59 million and EUR 6.@@ 44 million respectively.
Sup@@ port must be given for the re@@ forest@@ ation of the affected areas – taking account of their bio-@@ clim@@ atic and ecological characteristics – and for forest fire prevention measures, such as fire@@ break@@ s, forest track@@ s, access point@@ s, water points and fore@@ stry programm@@ es.
Im@@ medi@@ ate assistance is needed to protect the life and health of these individuals.
As@@ sist@@ ance will be targ@@ et@@ ed, too, to the D@@ omin@@ ic@@ an Republic@@ .
Nevertheless, technical assistance is necessary.
A consumer group, animal protection group or local media organisation will be able to request the inspection reports and thus be responsible for this function, t@@ elling people how things appear behind the scen@@ es.
An organisation has been set up called 'S@@ top the European City Gu@@ ide@@ ', an association of victims of this gu@@ ide.
An association from L@@ il@@ le, set up in 199@@ 5, has set up a contact group in R@@ ot@@ ter@@ dam to re@@ patri@@ ate these deeply dist@@ res@@ sed young people.
Associ@@ ate memb@@ ership via the Mediterranean Union can comple@@ ment but not take the place of the integration process.
A personal and vit@@ ri@@ olic attack like that is un@@ justified when the person is not present.
The more ou@@ tr@@ age@@ ous, shock@@ ing, un@@ expected and atten@@ tion@@ -@@ gr@@ ab@@ b@@ ing an attack is, the greater its success.
A viol@@ ation of the way in which they feel they lead their life as a woman.
Special attention has also been given to new media - mainly Internet websites - defin@@ ing clear safe@@ gu@@ ard@@ s, developing mechanisms for the monitoring of contents and ensuring specific provision for proper enforc@@ ement.
Specific attention should be paid to women's health care and hygiene need@@ s.
Simil@@ arly, particular emphasis must be given to dissemin@@ ating routine child and maternal health care, so as to reduce mortality rates.
Special attention should be given to last week@@ 's far@@ -@@ right r@@ ally in Pr@@ agu@@ e, which attemp@@ ted to cel@@ eb@@ rate the 19@@ 38 anti-@@ Je@@ wish pur@@ ge known as the K@@ rist@@ all@@ n@@ ach@@ t on 9 Nov@@ emb@@ er.
Special attention is paid to HIV prevention in relation to mothers and children.
Par@@ ticular care is needed in sensitive areas, such as par@@ ks and public or school play@@ groun@@ ds.
They will pay particular attention to the expected developments in this fiel@@ d: the continuing inter@@ nation@@ alisation of foot@@ b@@ all@@ ; trou@@ ble@@ mak@@ ers developing counter-@@ strategies to deal with measures taken to combat ho@@ olig@@ an@@ ism@@ ; solutions aimed at reduc@@ ing, or even elimin@@ ating, internal border control@@ s, in connection with the growth of the EU@@ ; the emergence of forms of extre@@ mis@@ m in violence surrounding spor@@ ting event@@ s; the progressive and continuing commerci@@ alisation of foot@@ b@@ all@@ ; and the ga@@ ther@@ ing of ho@@ olig@@ ans in groups that act as a unit rather than as individuals.
Careful attention and res@@ our@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness will be needed to maintain the mom@@ ent@@ um in implementing the peace agre@@ ements.
Special attention has been de@@ voted to problems in boar@@ ding and al@@ igh@@ ting from trains and to oblig@@ ations relating to ev@@ acu@@ ation in emerg@@ encies.
Special attention should be given to the content of the multi@@ media, in order to promote positive images of women, such as the am@@ az@@ ing performance of women at all levels of education.
There are also reasons to be al@@ er@@ t.
A@@ lo@@ of@@ ness and sel@@ fish@@ ness never lead any@@ where.
The only possible response is a hard@@ line at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de.
A fri@@ vol@@ ous attitude can result in tragic consequences.
Mark@@ et@@ -@@ ori@@ ented at@@ trac@@ tion is prefer@@ able.
A hearing with EMEA has been scheduled to this effect for mid-@@ Jul@@ y.
A 16% increase in the number of officials for some years, as in the EU, would never be author@@ is@@ ed; nor would an increase in pen@@ sion costs of more than 10% in one year.
An increase in this percentage would lead to higher lo@@ ans and, consequ@@ ently, greater support for the areas concerned, and greater profit@@ ability for the Ban@@ k or, altern@@ atively, with the same amount of reven@@ u@@ e, a reduction in the applicable rates.
Incre@@ ases in these defic@@ its only perpe@@ tu@@ ate this spir@@ al, and it is imper@@ ative that they be stopped.
An increase in output of milk will lead to a drop in prices.
An increase in the tax@@ ation of energy could be advant@@ age@@ ously combined with a reduction in the costs imposed on lab@@ our@@ .
An increase in production efficiency as a result of innov@@ ations should also be beneficial to employe@@ es, for example by leading to shorter working hours and a re@@ distribution of tas@@ ks.
An increase in cases of leukaemia has been reported recently in T@@ ar@@ an@@ to through the Il@@ va ste@@ el@@ work@@ s, as well asbe@@ sto@@ s removal in schools in C@@ rot@@ one and diox@@ ins in C@@ amp@@ ani@@ a.
High@@ er charges in Swit@@ zer@@ land should result in equally high tol@@ l rates for the B@@ ren@@ ner Pas@@ s.
An increase in funding for the LIF@@ E@@ + programme.
An increase in the total number of MEP@@ s by 15 (from the 7@@ 36 stipul@@ ated in the Treaty of N@@ ice to 75@@ 1), with 18 additional seats to be distributed among 12 Member States, has been adop@@ ted.
There is the risk that an un@@ justified increase in the production of biofu@@ els will compe@@ te with food production.
A rather limited increase for research together with a negative reserve is acceptable.
A shar@@ p increase in the number of lawy@@ ers with a simultaneous relax@@ ation in the Fe@@ es Or@@ din@@ ance has led to a situation in Germany, for instance, whereby highly qualified legal advice is only offered at st@@ agg@@ er@@ ingly high hour@@ ly rates while at the lower end of the market, a great many lawy@@ ers work for roc@@ k bottom prices.
The issu@@ ing of an authorisation for a medicinal product for human or veterinary use does not, however, signal the end of checks on its efficacy and safety.
An authorisation depends on a positive benefit@@ /@@ risk rati@@ o, on the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicine itsel@@ f, on its own mer@@ it.
A national independent supervisory authority should be established which will interven@@ e in the event of dis@@ agreement over a charg@@ ing decision.
An authority that understand@@ s that risk can never be eliminated but it can be adequately spot@@ ted and dealt with.
Another absur@@ d@@ ity is the provision whereby the period of detention may be increased in the absence of '@@ administr@@ ati@@ ve@@ ' cooperation from the country of origin.
Another improvement is that the new rules apply to all the institution@@ s' documents.
Another hearing – the Court hearing – will take place in Luxembourg on 24@@ -2@@ 8 April 2006.
Another step forwar@@ d: Eur@@ at@@ om.
Another key fe@@ ature is that the State should have control over arms.
Another category could be household appli@@ ances.
Another cause of the crisis is a glob@@ alisation concept that has made complete de@@ regulation its highest prior@@ ity.
Another reason is the green@@ house effect which can affect ar@@ able land.
Another contrib@@ uting cause is the j@@ ust@@ -in-@@ time method which companies, having usually reduced their storage capac@@ ities, adopt in order to maintain continuous production, a meth@@ od, that is, which requires them to produce a continu@@ al, regular supply of materials to be worked up@@ on.
One other thing is also as certain@@ : it is necessary to have the means to measure this competitiv@@ eness and to act upon its causes and on any hin@@ dr@@ ances to it.
Another question is what the rate will be for companies.
Another compan@@ y, Be@@ av@@ er 84 Lt@@ d, of Bas@@ ild@@ on was not even told by its intermedi@@ ary that its application for a financial le@@ ase was even on the list for a European subsid@@ y.
A further finding relates to pl@@ ann@@ ing.
Another of Parliament@@ ’s contribu@@ tions is to set out detailed requirements for containing and monitoring this power – Article 8 – with the aim of preventing and diagno@@ sing as sw@@ if@@ tly as possible any adverse effect on health due to exposure to electro@@ magnetic fiel@@ ds.
Another of the main reasons for the ine@@ ffici@@ ency of European defence is the lack of a common defence market.
Another of your great achiev@@ ements was that the European Union sw@@ allowed up n@@ ine-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half new countries.
Another difficulty is the ple@@ th@@ or@@ a of rules that make any control system in@@ effective.
Another difficulty resid@@ es in the fact that the Gr@@ and Du@@ ch@@ y of Luxembourg is a tr@@ il@@ ing@@ ual country.
In addition, a provision regul@@ ating the ad@@ mission of volunteers was added to the proposal, protec@@ ting such individuals from a potential legal lo@@ op@@ ho@@ le.
Another error is that questions relating to asylum and those relating to em@@ ig@@ ration have been dealt with in the same way.
Another major step that deser@@ ves particular attention is the establishment of the European Qual@@ ific@@ ations Fra@@ me@@ work, which should ensure the transparent treatment of education irrespective of the method of at@@ taining the underlying qualific@@ ations.
A different Europe is possible and necessary.
In another de@@ par@@ ture from more regular procedu@@ res, this report will be available and in fact, is available - I have a copy here - in large print for those who have difficulty see@@ ing, and also on dis@@ ket@@ t@@ e.
One quite frequent irregular@@ ity is that projects have been approved without an environmental impact assessment being made fir@@ st.
Another of the important measures to be adopted is the reduction in the fishing seas@@ on and the extension of the closed seas@@ ons for pur@@ se se@@ in@@ ers, long-@@ lin@@ ers, live ba@@ it and tro@@ l@@ ling bo@@ ats, pel@@ ag@@ ic tra@@ w@@ l@@ ers and rec@@ re@@ ational fish@@ ing.
A further important step would be the transfer and dissemination of successful methods of treatment to all countries of the European Union, including centres with less experience in the treatment of cancer, in order to improve the provision of effective treatment.
A second possible way of getting ri@@ d of it would be using inciner@@ ation, which is both cost@@ ly and damaging to the environment.
Another successful method of ensuring the safety of pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans is through an active vehicle bon@@ ne@@ t, which has been install@@ ed in the C@@ 6.
A further significant amendment related to the tooth fish TA@@ C around the He@@ ard and Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ d is@@ land@@ s, which has increased to 12 times the amoun@@ t, from 29@@ 7 to 3, 800 tonnes.
Another concerned setting up a European coast@@ guard service or body before 20@@ 10.
Another sha@@ re, 600@@ , 000 tic@@ ket@@ s, was handled by the host n@@ ation, which reserv@@ ed 37 % of this quo@@ ta.
Another part of Europe has other competitive advant@@ ages.
Another part can be achieved by using biofu@@ els, provided the most efficient kind is used.
Another 14 year old, who was fle@@ eing a police gas attack@@ , dro@@ wn@@ ed after falling into a ri@@ ver.
Another complain@@ t is that too many Turk@@ ish sett@@ l@@ ers will remain on the is@@ land.
Altern@@ atively, we could use different wording at another point within the relevant ar@@ tic@@ le.
There was also the question you put about the multi@@ plication of possible li@@ tig@@ ation.
Another question was about audi@@ ov@@ is@@ u@@ als.
Another matter concerns the protection of children from harmful content, such as scen@@ es of brut@@ ality and pornograph@@ y, through appropriate fil@@ ters and educ@@ ating paren@@ ts.
The question is al@@ so@@ : why do animals have to be transported so far@@ ?
Another issue is the set of rules for di@@ vest@@ ment.
Another important question is whether people can identify with a European Union in which decisions are taken at such a dist@@ ance.
Another important matter is the use of micro@@ b@@ es, which is a new innov@@ ation.
Another important mat@@ ter@@ : all aircraft up@@ wards of a tak@@ e-@@ off weight of 5.@@ 7 tonnes must be included in the emissions trading scheme.
Another subject being discussed is the release of the Albani@@ ans held in prison@@ s, particularly F@@ lor@@ a Bro@@ v@@ ina, a woman of ex@@ traordinary human@@ ity whom I me@@ t, together with the Women in B@@ lack of Bel@@ gra@@ de, during joint attempts to build bridg@@ es between women from different ethnic groups.
This is another of the problems which have emerg@@ ed during this deb@@ at@@ e: do you apply equal rig@@ our in the event of de@@ vi@@ ation on the part of France, Germany or Italy, whose defic@@ its are approach@@ ing or have already exceeded 3@@ %@@ ?
Another is that in an area such as this it is very difficult to produce effective so-called solutions.
A further reserv@@ ation concerns the use of studies into the energy consumption of build@@ ings.
Another very important set of rules the '@@ Statistics law@@ ' is in the off@@ ing.
The procedures have been tigh@@ tened further by allowing the decision on the conduct of certain clinical trials to be based p@@ urely on a notification procedure.
Altern@@ atively, we should inv@@ est in achieving the 3% objective for research and development that was set back in 2000@@ .
Another cause for concern is the ca@@ val@@ ier manner in which some transport operations are carried out.
Another technique is to eliminate serious op@@ pon@@ ents by loc@@ king them up on the basis of false acc@@ us@@ ations, getting them killed in car accidents or having them simply disappear.
There is another unit working with in@@ surance undertak@@ ings and there is a third unit working with the stock ex@@ chang@@ e.
Another way is to be opened up.
A particular aver@@ sion to the S@@ lav@@ onic languages and cultures can be observed.
We can only j@@ ust, with gr@@ itted te@@ e@@ th, with@@ stand a 10 % reduction, above all because only 50 % of this will be compens@@ ated.
A 1% drop in growth results in 20 million people falling into pover@@ ty.
A further drop in the number of livestock in the EU may cause significant changes in production, which would upset the supply of food in the EU.
A bal@@ e of ha@@ y costs five times as much in the Western Is@@ les as it does just outside the ne@@ are@@ st city of In@@ ver@@ ness.
Almost one person every minute is killed by the bul@@ let from a gun and two million children have been killed in the last dec@@ ade.
An electric f@@ ence is almost complete between Zimbab@@ we and Bot@@ sw@@ an@@ a.
A database called AN@@ IM@@ O is to be used in connection with this for communication between the different st@@ ations.
It might benefit patients if a database were to be set up with information on healthcare service provi@@ ders in the other Member States.
A computer@@ ised database will also allow the trace@@ ability of every process implemented to protect the family unit while they are in the process of rese@@ tt@@ ling.
However, a per@@ tin@@ ent bas@@ e, and hence the applicable procedure, can only be identified in line with the nat@@ ure, objectives and scope of any individual measure possibly envisaged after the White Pap@@ er.
A terrib@@ le be@@ aut@@ y has been bor@@ n.
A P@@ and@@ or@@ a@@ ’s box has been open@@ ed, ex@@ posing different vis@@ ions of Europe.

Such coordination would require an enormous new ap@@ par@@ at@@ us.
A coordination of the projects in the particular sp@@ here of employment with those in the sp@@ here of further voc@@ ational training is required.
The effective coordination of the exchange of information is therefore not an unnecessary lux@@ ury.
Effective coordination requires a reliable and comprehensive store of knowledge on diagnosis and treatment of infectious equ@@ ine diseases.
Coordination is also required in all functional and regulatory areas.
Coordination within the EU is also required so that our measures are not ren@@ dered in@@ effective at a global level.
In@@ ten@@ sive coordination was implemented with the support of the Council Secretariat and the Associ@@ ated States were kept constantly in@@ formed.

One of the issues that has not really been taken into account is the control and accoun@@ tability of these police gu@@ ard@@ s.
One of the most important issues is the abol@@ ition of the ex@@ equ@@ at@@ ur procedure.
One of the most important questions is that of li@@ ability and who pa@@ ys if there is a crisis like BSE@@ .
One of the most interesting of all the issues in this report, from the point of view of the various interest groups, has been that concerning the change in the volati@@ l@@ ity limit for petro@@ l.
One of the issues that has most divided the Members of this House has been the question of a ple@@ bis@@ cit@@ e.
One reason for this problem is the reduction in interven@@ tion, which was a serious mistak@@ e.
One of the reasons is that one in five projects was ref@@ used by the Commission or withdrawn due to the level of administrative requirements.
One of the reasons is the lack of progress in the American Sen@@ ate.
One of the reasons for this was the failure to have a second round of the Gen@@ eva peace tal@@ ks, with the LT@@ TE pul@@ ling out.
One of the reasons for this is that falsi@@ fied medicinal products and drugs sold in places not authorised to sell them do not meet the quality requirements set for medicinal products, and contain prohibited substances whose use may have unknown consequences.
One of the reasons for this is that medicines are for the most part too expensive for the people of those countries.
One of the official reasons given for the entire operation was that they were trying to prevent the spread of disease, but the fact that there was no treatment available after the ev@@ ic@@ tions ca@@ sts doubt on the govern@@ ment@@ 's motiv@@ es.
One of the main reasons this has not been done is that the lic@@ ences are nation@@ al.
One of the reasons why I have been so sti@@ r@@ red up about all this is that I have been on the receiving end of a large number of letters from people in my own country who suffer from Parkinson's Dis@@ eas@@ e, chronic heart disease or diabetes, or from their carers in the case of Alzheimer's Dis@@ eas@@ e.
Consequently, one of the most important recommendations of the Committee of In@@ qu@@ iry was the replacement of this whole ar@@ cha@@ ic system, based on paper and st@@ amp@@ s, with a computer@@ ised system.
It would only be possible to determine the in@@ compatibility of aid following specific investigation of each case.
A second priority measure is training and ref@@ re@@ sh@@ er courses for professionals so as to improve early diagnos@@ is, identi@@ fic@@ ation, intervention and preven@@ tion.
A second improvement consists of the list of activities that can be supported and that are referred to in Article 4.
I could have mentioned other projects within the first category but the second category includes projects that are ongoing and that are also being undertaken with conc@@ ession contract@@ s, such as the Ath@@ ens ring road and the Ri@@ o-@@ Anti@@ ri@@ o bridg@@ e.
A second round of conc@@ iliation achieved an increase of EUR 1.@@ 1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million.
A second consideration is the need or the possibility to adjust the path of deficit correc@@ tion, the speed with which a country which is above the 3% must bring its public deficit below that reference valu@@ e.
A second provision relates to the increase in the EF@@ F aid intensity for fu@@ el@@ -@@ saving equip@@ ment.
A second step must then be to increase value added through export@@ s.
A second EF@@ SA safety assessment in October 2004 came to the same conclus@@ ion.
Second@@ ly, it is un@@ clear why on earth 30 out of the 35 cases - for we have to include the recent seizure in a gar@@ age in B@@ av@@ aria of 27@@ 7 kg of highly en@@ ric@@ hed uranium - have occurred in Germany.
A second reason for European intervention is the making available of reliable and ver@@ ifi@@ able data.
One of your priorities is the Europe of immigr@@ ation, but the Europe of immigr@@ ation cannot be reduced to a Europe of exp@@ ul@@ sions.
A notic@@ eable difference has been made where proper tax increases have been implemented.
There is a differenti@@ ation according to the Member States and greater account will be taken of in@@ put@@ s.
A further difficulty will lie in the fact that these are Western advis@@ ers, with the result that Russi@@ an, M@@ ong@@ ol@@ ian or Kal@@ mu@@ k advis@@ ers will not be taken into consideration at all.
High@@ -@@ quality research dissemination also helps to legitim@@ ise soci@@ et@@ y's investment in research and to awa@@ ken young people's interest in becoming research@@ ers.
A reduction of 2 deci@@ bel@@ s is technically possible without jeop@@ ardis@@ ing safety.
There has been a 6% to 10% decrease in oz@@ one since 198@@ 0@@ .
· A minimum 6@@ 5% reduction in bio-@@ degrad@@ able waste pres@@ ently consi@@ gn@@ ed for landfill sites.
Examples of this are the lowering of the requirements for risk@@ ier borrow@@ ers; a dis@@ count of on average 10% for smaller borrow@@ ers and allowing SME@@ s to be included in the re@@ tail port@@ foli@@ o when the lo@@ an is for less than EUR 1 million.
Ris@@ ks can be reduced only if cooperation between produc@@ ers, users and the authorities is maxim@@ ised.
A reduction in the number of projects and the scope of the specific programmes is, however, essential to serious concentr@@ ation.
If the minimum moist@@ ure content threshold were lo@@ wered this would reduce the comp@@ ass of the intervention safety net and increase the proportion of the ce@@ real cro@@ p which is, in principle@@ , excluded from interven@@ tion.
To reduce the risks related to bath@@ ing, a bath@@ ing water directive was introduced in 197@@ 6.
An empty directive may do no harm@@ , but at the same time it can do no go@@ od.
A debate in this case is oblig@@ ator@@ y!
A discrimin@@ ating provision providing for the possibility of re@@ taining a qualification only if work had not been interrupted for two out of the last five years, has been del@@ et@@ ed.
A provision has also been included which guarante@@ es the right to stri@@ ke.
A new provision also allows the required two years professional experience to be avoided.
The proposal contains a special provision to enhance the protection of children during the investigation and assistance.
The items that must be destroyed and removed from the food chain are quite clearly defin@@ ed, as are the conditions for their removal and de@@ struc@@ tion.
A clear distinc@@ tion must be made between the acceptable daily intake of a food additive which is p@@ urely based on science and the maximum permitted use level of a food additive in a given food@@ st@@ u@@ ff which is determined taking into account a series of criteria laid down in the legislation.

A direct calc@@ ulation shows that, if the reduction had been based on six and not three gas@@ es, the reduction would have been equivalent to 12 %.
A response is needed that involves European intervention and strong international co@@ operation.
A rapid response by the European Union is therefore cru@@ ci@@ al.
A recent British study also revealed that police had identified 31 pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ ile rings in an area of just 7@@ 00@@ , 000 people.
A recent study by Dr Ra@@ ja M@@ uk@@ her@@ je@@ e, Lond@@ on, claims that drinking any amount of alcohol can be damaging and that one in every 100 babies born is damaged by their mother drinking while pregnant but that many cases go un@@ recogn@@ ised.

A reduction in these substances is therefore a vital step to take in the interests of preventing a whole range of diseases, particularly bronch@@ ial conditions.
Any reduction in compensation would be particularly damaging to the mixed farm@@ s.
A reduction in be@@ am leng@@ ths reduces efficiency rather than increasing selec@@ tiv@@ ity, and, as su@@ ch, would not be considered as a technical measure.

A more moderate price cut@@ , together with the conditions mention@@ ed, would grant more chances of survival to sugar be@@ et production and sugar industry in mid@@ field Member States, such as Hung@@ ary.
Any reduction in the quantities used will always be dependent on the effectiveness of the means used.

One major result is that in the principal sec@@ tion, the range of otherwise well-@@ chosen items recommended as priorities by the Committee has been expan@@ ded.
A decrease of the annual reduction would also conf@@ ron@@ t the sector with a longer reduction period and therefore delay the benefit of big@@ ger and more stable catches and would make it unlikely that the MS@@ Y levels can be reached before 20@@ 15, as is required under the Joh@@ ann@@ es@@ burg Commit@@ ment.

A society in which everything can be bought and sold.
A society which suppos@@ edly stri@@ ves to pro@@ long the average life@@ time, indeed under the best possible conditions of surviv@@ al, cannot possibly allow the spi@@ rit of old people and their person@@ ality, for the sa@@ ke of vor@@ ac@@ ious '@@ profit@@ ' , to succ@@ um@@ b to the effects of a disease so dist@@ res@@ sing and de@@ struc@@ tive, both for the patient and his or her famil@@ y.

A different solution could mean dela@@ ying the solution for a long time.
A solution must be provided, to the production system and to the Member States.
A long-term and lasting solution can only be found if all these factors are taken into account.
A solidar@@ ity-@@ based European solution for O@@ pe@@ l is possible, but the Commission must get involved.
There is a way.
A negoti@@ ated sett@@ lement is clearly the best solution and the best way forward - maybe 199@@ 2 pl@@ us.
A non-@@ harmonised solution as proposed in Amendment No 35 is not sustainable with the internal market.
One way to solve the situation is through the possibility of inter@@ -@@ regional co@@ operation.
One such solution is the production of bio-@@ ethan@@ ol for adding to motor fu@@ els.
A more structural solution would be if the media millions were better distrib@@ uted.
A solution has been found to the problems of the United Kingdom@@ , Ireland and Denmark@@ .
A pr@@ ag@@ m@@ atic solution was also found to flight time limit@@ ations.
A proportional solution, which could be extended past the six months, might also help those medicines that are very expensive because of the research involved and that have a small market to have a longer exten@@ sion.

Mu@@ ch better supervision is being carried out, there is much better identification of the health problems which can arise and, of course, this mean@@ s, from a practical point of view, fewer diseases for the animals, fewer fat@@ al@@ ities, fewer un@@ suitable chickens in such cases and, h@@ ence, fewer losses and lower costs.
C@@ los@@ er monitoring of the market then needs to be put into practic@@ e, which goes hand in hand with product safety.
Effective traffic surveill@@ ance, including vehicle inspec@@ tions, speed monitoring using modern cam@@ era techniqu@@ es, breath@@ alys@@ er tests, seat bel@@ t checks and pup@@ ill@@ ometer measurement in cases where drug@@ -@@ use may be suspected, is what is needed in the short term to bring down the number of fat@@ alities on the road@@ s.
Close monitor@@ ing, both of the types of waste incin@@ erated and the harmful substances ar@@ ising as a result of the process, is an important condition for the safe ther@@ mal util@@ isation of waste.

This is not only important for the work@@ ers' own health, safety and well-@@ being, but also for that of those in@@ directly involved.
This represents an almost 6@@ 3% increase in the number of users in one year.
S@@ urely that is a catastroph@@ e?
That w@@ ould, of course, be per@@ mis@@ sible, as we see evid@@ enced by the fact that in the Republic of Ireland the name of the region is given on the num@@ ber@@ plate in Er@@ se and in Germany the L@@ and bad@@ ge is also shown conven@@ tionally on the num@@ ber@@ pl@@ ates.
This run@@ s coun@@ ter to what has been called the ‘@@ fem@@ in@@ isation of age@@ ing@@ ’, as men form the majority of the population up to about the age of 45 and women thereafter.
This will result in falling standards in the majority of school@@ s, especially in work@@ ing-@@ class di@@ stric@@ ts and the country@@ side.
So there@@ !
That is how it stand@@ s.
There you have it.
Those are all the events, or the diagnosis of the facts that the European Union has taken into account in order to react and act in response to this, and I feel that the EU has acted correctly throughout this period.
This is an op@@ pon@@ ent who already habit@@ ually h@@ its below the bel@@ t, while the refe@@ ree looks on in@@ differently and the judg@@ es arg@@ ue about what the drug@@ -@@ tak@@ er's illegal pun@@ ches are worth - full or half point@@ s!
This is another example of Iraq@@ 's attempts to divide and ru@@ le@@ : to separate out elements of the anti-@@ Iraq alli@@ ance.
This is another of the great mess@@ ages of Tam@@ pe@@ re.
This is most un@@ democ@@ rati@@ c.
This is yet again an ill@@ u@@ stration of the much talked about squ@@ aring of the cir@@ cle@@ .
This is a way of working hard and fast but in a de@@ struc@@ tive manner.
This was an extremely cour@@ age@@ ous fe@@ at, and one which none of your pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors achieved, in any case not the two men who were your immediate pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors.
This is a major develop@@ ment@@ !
An en@@ viable role for this most chang@@ eable lad@@ y!
You se@@ e: there it is.
It is un@@ be@@ ar@@ able to watch the way in which these men and women are sum@@ mon@@ ed to sub@@ mit evidence of the acts of tor@@ ture that they have suffe@@ red.
P@@ oul@@ try and Man@@ ure and S@@ l@@ ur@@ r@@ y.
Rob@@ b@@ ing a poor Pet@@ er to pay P@@ au@@ l is an in@@ verse Rob@@ in Ho@@ od policy and is at best per@@ ver@@ se.
N@@ ight flights and excessive noise
Where@@ as Vol@@ ta@@ ire regarded the J@@ es@@ u@@ its as his b@@ ê@@ te no@@ ire , the Vol@@ ta@@ ire network seems fix@@ ated on the Op@@ us De@@ i group, but as a writ@@ er Vol@@ ta@@ ire at least had tal@@ ent and sty@@ le.
Vol@@ vo and Sa@@ ab are well-known mak@@ es.
Are they getting to the root of the problems and the resul@@ ts?
Should they now spo@@ il the OEC@@ D agre@@ ement@@ s?
Will they be re@@ negoti@@ ated?
Will they discuss energ@@ y?
Your actions mean that you have become the aggres@@ sor@@ , not the victim@@ .
Your record is app@@ alling and the answer has got to be, for good@@ ness@@ ' s@@ ake, keep your nose out of this.
Will any of this be taken into consideration in your impact assess@@ ments?
Ap@@ pl@@ ause pleas@@ e!
Your other priorities will be tack@@ led as well.
It is one of which you and your colleagu@@ es, and indeed your public serv@@ ice, can be j@@ ust@@ ly pro@@ ud@@ .
Your comments have been no@@ ted.
Your cri@@ es will not h@@ ide your responsibility in the crisis, the crisis of euro@@ -@@ inter@@ nation@@ alism, of which you are the pro@@ pon@@ ents.
Your words will be recorded carefully in the Min@@ ut@@ es.
Your children were with you all the way.
Your examples are mis@@ lead@@ ing.
Your ideas on flexible form@@ ats for courses in some study areas would be compatible with the B@@ olog@@ na rules and deser@@ ve to be explo@@ red.
You may think that the end@@ less hec@@ k@@ ling is fun@@ n@@ y, but it does not get us any@@ where.
Both your interven@@ tions - this one and the one you made earlier - have been recor@@ ded.
Your measures are frag@@ ment@@ ary.
Your reci@@ pe will be con@@ test@@ ed, but not by Liber@@ als and Dem@@ oc@@ rats.
Is there not an absur@@ d@@ ity, a par@@ ad@@ ox in your economic polici@@ es?
You were very precise and it was very interest@@ ing.
Your proposals and deb@@ ates have influ@@ enced the major re@@ forms of the Union during all these years.
Is this possible, based on your propos@@ al@@ s?
Your proposals are neither rob@@ ust nor en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed.
You only want less, and you present this as an inev@@ itable development.
Your proposals take approximately the same direction as the proposals made by the Commission in its own communic@@ ation.
Your words do not contradic@@ t what I said.
Your words were much appreci@@ ated.
Your reas@@ sur@@ ances that all is well do not work.
This too will be included in the Ver@@ b@@ ati@@ m Report@@ .
Your reports on these three top@@ ics have therefore come at the right time.
Under your re@@ forms you will break the link between production and subsid@@ y.
No pre@@ tence is made that your regulations for public contracts are anything other than means towards the wed@@ g@@ ing open of the market@@ ; you may be putting two box@@ ers in a r@@ ing, but one of them weigh@@ s 100 kg more than the other.
Your regul@@ ations, which are un@@ consolid@@ ated, den@@ se, sometimes in@@ cohe@@ rent if not absur@@ d, are not responsib@@ le@@ !
Because of what you say and because of the difference in the testing procedu@@ res, which cannot be agre@@ ed, it is going to take some time.
You may be doing very nic@@ ely financ@@ i@@ ally, but if you live in a den@@ sely popul@@ ated city with too much air pollu@@ tion, your quality of life is not all that won@@ der@@ ful.
Your attempts to resus@@ cit@@ ate it are as dist@@ a@@ ste@@ ful as they are ill@@ -f@@ ated.

Your amendment for maintaining the private storage of cream and sk@@ im@@ med milk powder is a little surpris@@ ing because these schem@@ es have never been used in practice and can be considered ob@@ so@@ let@@ e.
Your English is won@@ der@@ ful@@ !
Your an@@ thro@@ pol@@ og@@ y has a little of L@@ evi@@ Strauss in it@@ : for him@@ , it was the raw and the co@@ ok@@ ed, for you it is the open and sh@@ ut@@ !
Your approach in terms of reproductive health diff@@ ers from min@@ e.
Your comprehensive approach@@ ?
Member of the Commission. - The point you are making is very val@@ id.
Your attitude is completely st@@ up@@ id.
Your medical health fun@@ d would know that you are homosex@@ ual and your employ@@ er would know all about your previous and expected future illnesses and your fore@@ fa@@ ther@@ s.
Your time@@ table@@ ?
Your ability to demonstrate that you have had a role that be@@ f@@ its the President of the Commission in decid@@ ing who should be in your Commission and what their port@@ foli@@ os should be - all these things will give your presidency and your Commission its opening streng@@ ths and, inde@@ ed, could well give them its opening weakness@@ es.
Your celebr@@ ation of the Union's success was both tim@@ ely and appropriate.
Your l@@ oud@@ ness does not make up for your argum@@ ents.
Your fifth question was whether the duration of F@@ P@@ 7 should be syn@@ chron@@ ised with the Financial Per@@ spec@@ tives to ensure a better coordination of planning activi@@ ties?
There are not many farmers in your constitu@@ ency, are there@@ ?@@ !
Your Commission in@@ her@@ ited the bat@@ tered but hop@@ eful Europe of 198@@ 9, still divided by a line from Tri@@ est@@ e to G@@ dan@@ sk@@ .
Your Tem@@ por@@ ary Committee has identified five specific recommendations which it considers have not been implemented.
Your Commission should make sure that such ob@@ struction does not occur.
Your Commission consists of the only 20 people in the EU who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced.
Your Commission is in the process of appro@@ ving the production and distribution on the European market of new medicinal and other products, the harm@@ lessness of which in the short and medium term is far from guarante@@ ed.
Y@@ ours is a medi@@ oc@@ re Commission on account of its hyper@@ liber@@ alism, on account of all the priv@@ atis@@ ation, and for the fact that it does not condem@@ n the war@@ .
You have a ‘@@ vari@@ ab@@ le-@@ ge@@ ome@@ tr@@ y@@ ’ take on the la@@ w.
You seem to be convinc@@ ed that the in that regard is your own mod@@ el, as it limits apparent unemployment to some 5% of the active population.
Your second argument is that the criticism is un@@ specific@@ .
Your second request is the immediate abol@@ ition of vis@@ a requirements.
Your diagnosis was correct and you put forward concrete measures.
Your speech proved interesting enough to stop the c@@ loc@@ k.
Your speech was lac@@ king in spir@@ it.
Your document only men@@ tions flex@@ ic@@ urity and training.
Your document is also lit@@ tered with mistak@@ es and half-@@ truth@@ s.
Your im@@ peri@@ alist dog@@ ma of '@@ divide and ru@@ le@@ ' is well known.
Your E@@ min@@ ence, it was a pleas@@ ure to be able to speak to you this morning.
Your obvious eng@@ agement made it impossible for me to interrup@@ t you when your allotted ten minutes of speaking time were up.
Your Spanish is impres@@ sive, Mr H@@ ann@@ an.
Your state, for pit@@ y's s@@ ak@@ e!
You have therefore sur@@ passed yourself in your consideration of the time that you ha@@ d.
Perhaps you would also let us know where you like eating lob@@ ster, as you use it as such an el@@ eg@@ ant example.
Your Government has ap@@ olog@@ ised for the Am@@ rit@@ s@@ ar massac@@ re@@ ; you have ap@@ olog@@ ised for sla@@ very@@ ; you have ap@@ olog@@ ised for virtually every@@ thing.
Your famous po@@ et Fern@@ and@@ o P@@ ess@@ o@@ a once w@@ ro@@ te@@ : '@@ No intellig@@ ent idea can gain general accept@@ ance unless some st@@ up@@ idity is mixed in with it@@ '.
Your group is continuing on its own with this second part of the amend@@ ment.
Your own Hel@@ m@@ ut K@@ oh@@ l also did his b@@ it, with the Sch@@ ä@@ ub@@ le@@ /@@ Lam@@ ers pap@@ er.
Your past is a less@@ on in determination and per@@ sever@@ ance, given the terrib@@ le difficulties that you have experienced and over@@ com@@ e.
So your hypo@@ thes@@ is is not correct.
Your intervention is very unfortunate because it is fal@@ se.
Your comments will be passed on and recorded in the Min@@ ut@@ es.
Your ple@@ a has therefore not been an entire waste.
It will be of much greater benefit to what you want to con@@ ve@@ y if you speak either more slowly or without a prepared speech@@ .
Such a method den@@ otes a marked feeling for the European institutions.
Your plan D method@@ ology promoting democrac@@ y, dialogue and debate is also interest@@ ing, provided, however, that it does not become the plan of dem@@ ag@@ og@@ y or of disappoint@@ ment.
Your point of order is therefore super@@ flu@@ ous.
Therefore, your point of order was out of place.
Your point of order was not appropriate.
Your motion was not voted on as it was tab@@ led after the relevant dead@@ line.
Your objec@@ tive, Mad@@ ame Pal@@ aci@@ o, is to get that worl@@ d-@@ wide effect.
Your point is clear, well made and well taken.
Your observation is not therefore relevant.
Your comment will also be recor@@ ded.
You are right.
Your powers of influence are consider@@ able@@ : you have a chance effectively to promote the aims of the entire Union in your day@@ -to-@@ day work.
Your first question concerns the phas@@ ing-@@ out of the be@@ ach@@ ing method - the method of dis@@ m@@ ant@@ ling end-@@ of-@@ life vessels directly on the be@@ ach@@ .
Your presence at the head of the Council is already a guarantee of determin@@ ation.
Your appearance will put off other din@@ er@@ s.@@ "
Your own Presidency has to be all about action.
Your chair@@ man@@ ship, Mrs @@ R@@ and@@ zi@@ o-@@ P@@ la@@ th, has been characterised by im@@ parti@@ ality, knowledge and profession@@ alism.
You rec@@ ited it very well.
Your work programme does not provide very definitive information in this respect.
You point down a completely different path in your programme.
Your question is most per@@ tin@@ ent.
Your report has been treated in exactly the same way as other reports - no more, no less.
Your report has made a good start by rejec@@ ting some of the mis@@ concep@@ tions and s@@ care stor@@ ies about the Constitu@@ tion.
It has been a matter of much concern to your rapporteur that there is in@@ consistency between the conform@@ ity assessment modul@@ es in Council Decision 9@@ 3@@ /4@@ 65@@ /@@ EE@@ C and Annex@@ es A to H@@ 1 of the common position.
Your rapporteur also received detailed information inform@@ ally at each step of the work carried out over the last six months.
The splen@@ did imag@@ es, the mus@@ ic and the d@@ anc@@ ing tell the story of A@@ l Man@@ sur@@ , vi@@ z@@ ir of C@@ ó@@ r@@ d@@ ob@@ a, the sh@@ ei@@ k Ri@@ ad and A@@ ver@@ ro@@ ë@@ s.
What exactly is your recommend@@ ation?
Your reform is cour@@ age@@ ous, for it adv@@ oc@@ ates, through dec@@ ou@@ pl@@ ing, a break with the approach of providing incen@@ tives for production.
Your par@@ rying of protection@@ ism is ad@@ mir@@ able.
You make a very valid point.
Your point is well made but has already been fully anticipated and acted on.
Mrs F@@ les@@ ch, your comment will be no@@ ted.
Your comment will, of course, be taken into consideration and noted in the Min@@ ut@@ es@@ .@@ (3)
Your comment will be passed on to the competent bodi@@ es.
Your line that it is '@@ possible to find a consen@@ sus in the context of a process leading to a conclus@@ ion@@ ' is one of S@@ ir@@  @@ Hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y's fin@@ est.
Your reply was most satisfactor@@ y.
From your answ@@ er, I received the impression that the Commission is either un@@ aware of the true situ@@ ation, is not in@@ formed, or is trying to br@@ ush off MEP@@ s.
This is not clear to me in your re@@ ply.
However, your response gave the impression that there was no complete recogn@@ ition of the fact that events are s@@ now@@ b@@ all@@ ing.
Your response would be most welcom@@ e.
Par@@ ts of No 17 are already included in the control regulation.
Your role demands it and the European Union requires it.
Your Hol@@ iness, you are a person@@ ality of dialogu@@ e.
Your secret@@ ariat said it would investigate it.
The s@@ log@@ an is the right one and it should also be pursu@@ ed under the Austrian presid@@ ency.
Your support and your aid thus continue to be essential to the development and promotion of the European Vol@@ untary Servic@@ e.
Your support will be an important reference for our follow-up work and for specific propos@@ als.
You succe@@ eded ad@@ mir@@ ably on both coun@@ ts.
You succe@@ e@@ ded, Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or, in obtaining results on all the points you had to addres@@ s.
Your success@@ or will be measured by the standard you have set in your deal@@ ings with this Hou@@ se.
Your speaking time has fin@@ ished.
You do not have any time lef@@ t.
Your work has been much appreci@@ ated.
It is your job to defend the Services Direc@@ tive, not to defend protection@@ ism.
Your work deser@@ ves more than respect.
It is not your job to decide for yourself how the Bud@@ get is to be administered, but to ensure that the administration actually carries out what the Council and Parliament have dec@@ ided.
Your eg@@ o will be fl@@ at@@ te@@ red, but the result will be sevent@@ een thousand more un@@ employed each month@@ , as happened again in France last month.
Your le@@ a@@ ther j@@ ack@@ et is by a European design@@ er, but it was made in Tur@@ ke@@ y.
Your vote has obviously not been counted if you did not have a card.
Your vote will be decis@@ ive.
Your artificial citizen@@ ship has no substance whatso@@ ever@@ .
Has a full environmental impact assessment taken place@@ ? Will the Ti@@ bet@@ an people be the sole benefici@@ aries of the projec@@ t?
Would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes.
How many other people in Europe work between 1000 and 2000 hours a year?
Do you want to free all dis@@ sid@@ ents in Spain as well@@ ?
Where there is a will there is a way.
Where there is a will there is a way ...
To want to reverse the trend and make them come to us sm@@ acks of a worrying mas@@ och@@ ism and loss of clear@@ -@@ he@@ ade@@ d@@ ness.
It is completely absur@@ d, given farm@@ ers' level of in@@ come, to try to put a ce@@ iling on aid and to reduce it ste@@ adi@@ ly.
Do we want to ch@@ ase the rab@@ bit or actually catch it?
Do we want a European j@@ udge who set free a qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ ple child murde@@ rer@@ ?
Do we want a minimum regi@@ me?
Yes, you are slaugh@@ tering animals.
You are fast@@ -@@ trac@@ king marketing lic@@ enc@@ es.
You accept a Coc@@ a Col@@ a-@@ type of wine made with water plus ingredi@@ ents, sugar, colour@@ ings and wo@@ od.
You are no@@ d@@ ding - perfec@@ t!
You ac@@ knowledge that with growth at less than 2.@@ 4% there was no reduction in employ@@ ment.
You must ad@@ mit that this makes things a bit mess@@ y.
You are weak@@ ening the trade un@@ ions.
You further state that you want an economy without b@@ orders and that excessive regulation should be avo@@ ide@@ d, that an increase in the level of protection@@ ism should be avoided.
You state that nuclear install@@ ations are designed and built to contain virtually all the by@@ products of their operation, even under accidental conditions.
You act as though you were responding with something ne@@ w.
Your behaviour stems from your own pre@@ judic@@ es, you are dispen@@ sing with any form of political debate and you are displa@@ ying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to op@@ pos@@ e.
You are acting with cau@@ tion, cal@@ m@@ ly, but purpos@@ eful@@ ly.
And then you go on to tell me - and I quote - on good authority that BI@@ V and the other retro@@ viruses found in animals have no effect on human health.
Then you say that it is now up to the Member States to make further de@@ duc@@ tions of up to 20 % for hol@@ dings which have a below@@ -@@ average number of workers, or in other words have reached a much more advanced stage of ration@@ alisation than other hol@@ d@@ ings.
You will drive it under@@ groun@@ d.
You even go so far as to ask for the immigr@@ ation of second and third w@@ iv@@ es and their children.
G@@ o and get yourselves killed with your eth@@ ics, with your mor@@ als, with your qu@@ est@@ s for absolut@@ es, with your di@@ gres@@ sion@@ s!
You may be able to lif@@ t it and go down in history with it, or you may fail completely.
You are going a little fast and there is a little delay.
You call this document – not necessarily very ap@@ tly – ‘@@ boost@@ ing trust through action@@ ’.
You are coming to the end of your presid@@ ency.
As a general pre@@ cep@@ t, I am sure you agree with that.
In this way, you will be able to give it another mobil@@ ity-@@ related function.
You are increasing export re@@ fun@@ ds, at any rate for cattle.
You will have an extra 30 second@@ s.
You would give it your best sh@@ ot@@ .
This you will have cause to reg@@ re@@ t.
You will deser@@ ve what you get@@ , in the longer term, when they start to go under@@ groun@@ d.
You will find it even more difficult to conv@@ ince a business@@ man that this worker has to keep on working long@@ er, and, in particular, even more difficult than that when people out there know that these pap@@ ers are written by people who rec@@ k@@ on on going in their fif@@ ties or early fif@@ ties with a gol@@ den hand@@ sha@@ ke.
You will get the results later this year as soon as they are available.
You shall have your 24-@@ hour period.
You should have been able to get all that done in Amster@@ dam@@ !
You should have re@@ v@@ oked their author@@ iz@@ ations a long time ago.
You would have run@@ g all the b@@ ell@@ s here, lit a thousand c@@ and@@ les and had the Te De@@ um stri@@ ke up.
You are allowing sugar to be added to Community win@@ es, especially to German win@@ es, in order to increase the alcohol content. This is in@@ consistent with the restriction on production and the quality that you are af@@ ter.
You have 15 seconds to say your final wor@@ d.
You have 15 second@@ s.
You are completely in@@ correc@@ t, si@@ r.
You have done some very good prepar@@ atory work and you have introduced important improvements in the welfare of laboratory animals, such as prior authorisation and follow-up checks for all tests.
You have made it clear that this is not about surveillance or sp@@ ying.
You indicated that you are concerned about the emissions from S@@ ell@@ af@@ iel@@ d.
You then have a choice of two cour@@ ses.
At the time you said@@ : "@@ Yes, open declar@@ ation should come into be@@ ing@@ .@@ "
You replied on that occas@@ ion that you had not had time to think about it.
You have been list@@ ening to your mother again.
You again demonstrated your capacity to work with every@@ one.
You now have A@@ A, A@@ +@@ , A@@ 20, A@@ 40, and soon all products will have some type of A rat@@ ing. Me@@ an@@ while, it is completely un@@ clear what that mean@@ s, which is hardly a good example of ec@@ od@@ es@@ ign@@ .
You@@ , yoursel@@ ves, have been the wit@@ ness@@ es to the emergence of this new colour on the European ma@@ p - the colour or@@ ang@@ e.
You have also mentioned the 3% and the 60@@ %, indicating that they had not been changed.
You also mentioned patent am@@ bus@@ h@@ es.
You have also been the em@@ bodi@@ ment of a message of hope and toler@@ ance.
You have allowed supplementary questions in a very flexible manner.
You need your credit card to book it and you need it to get the tic@@ k@@ et, which is impossible when you are in tran@@ sit@@ .
You were right to choose the tor@@ to@@ ise, represent@@ ing per@@ sever@@ ance, as a symbol during the Con@@ ven@@ tion.
You have done well to emphas@@ ize them.
You have made a good mov@@ e.
You are quite right that you have four minutes.
Lo@@ ok@@ , it is your right to act as you cho@@ ose, but it is also your responsibil@@ ity.
You conce@@ aled the contamination by me@@ at@@ -based meal in order to conce@@ al the contamination by your ide@@ as.
But in the mean@@ time you keep announc@@ ing the results of the bal@@ lo@@ ts.
I am sure you have children.
You supplied the scientific committees with all the information, but did you ask them any specific question@@ s?
You have the documents in your pos@@ session@@ .
You have been sing@@ ing the pra@@ ises of the tach@@ ograp@@ h and the great stri@@ des that its use has caused in the regulation of driving in Europe.
You mentioned the rise in Alzheimer's in your country.
You quo@@ ted your mother - well, as a mother@@ , can I ur@@ ge you to stop smoking, while sympath@@ ising with your p@@ light in the build@@ ing?
You started work at a very early age as a school@@ teach@@ er.
You have conc@@ eded a small amount of ground for vessels less than 12 metres long@@ , which is posi@@ tive.
You designed five by@@ z@@ antine tests that prevented British entry these past 10 years.
You have taken up time with two question@@ ers or people who have not taken the time to question the Commissioner properly.
You have correctly identified the route that needs to be followed in order to deal with the matter.
You first of all put to the vot@@ e, at the request of one group, the second part of paragraph 1 c) separ@@ ately, which required the an@@ nex to be considered.
This has been very favour@@ ably reported upon by many who contrib@@ uted.
You have in your f@@ ile a programme on the fil@@ ms being sho@@ wn.
You have the names on the voting list@@ s, and thus there is no need to repeat them.
More@@ over you are aware of the proposals that are in existence relating to the control of animal feed containing meat and bon@@ eme@@ al.
You spoke of the Europe of peoples more than the Europe of the institutions. It is the view and feeling of the European peoples that Europe is already one from the Atlantic to the U@@ ral mountain@@ s, from the tun@@ dr@@ a to An@@ at@@ ol@@ ia.
This was therefore a matter of actions speaking l@@ ou@@ der than wor@@ ds.
You said at the very beginning of this voting session that your eyes were playing you up.
You have said that '@@ in this world you cannot given 100@@ % guarante@@ es' but '@@ you can make sure the system is fit for purpos@@ e@@ '.
You have talked about product contamination being the starting point of this crisis, but there is still no apparent mis@@ ha@@ p to which blame can be attribut@@ ed.
You stated that only one or two percent are used in cour@@ t.
You described Europe as a rare and successful projec@@ t.
You yourself out@@ lined the challenges that we fac@@ e: a reduction in the numbers of be@@ e@@ ke@@ e@@ pers and the need to at@@ tract new and professional ap@@ i@@ ar@@ ists, and - cru@@ ci@@ ally - the increase in be@@ e mortality caused by a number of factors but, in particular, by the presence of the V@@ ar@@ ro@@ a mit@@ e, which compromis@@ es the immune system of be@@ es.
You have a lot on your pl@@ ate.
You have already understood that the Commission cannot accept GM@@ O@@ -free or non-@@ GM as an alternative to the mandatory labelling of GM@@ -@@ deriv@@ atives.
You have already gone one and a half minutes bey@@ o@@ ond your time.
You have been asked about this before and you have been ev@@ as@@ ive every time.
You have already changed the inflation range.
You have already shown in Italy that you are capable of taking it on.
You have had well over a minute al@@ read@@ y.
You have sho@@ wn, today, that you keep your word as a politic@@ i@@ an.
You have spok@@ en for 22 seconds more than your three minutes.
You have exceeded the 30 seconds of time I allocated to you.
You spoke for longer than the time allotted to you.
You have over@@ run your allotted speaking time by 25@@ %.

In addition you have the legitim@@ acy of having been elected by 6@@ 2% of the Palestinian elec@@ tor@@ ate, on the basis of that commit@@ ment.
You have concerns about the use of the data that are collec@@ ted.
You have children and you know how it is.
You have people available in B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing.
You have two minutes.
The votes contain thir@@ ty or so p@@ ages of text.

Pro@@ por@@ tional inde@@ ed!
You mentioned cancer as the second cause of death.

You have said the first data will be available in the autum@@ n.
You said that matters requiring the presence of the Council must be completed by 6.@@ 00@@  @@ p.m.
You have said you will do this by the end of the year.
You said that you would conduct them.
You said that you were not a dictator@@ ; you are a democr@@ at of distinc@@ tion.
If you say you believe the Commission acted di@@ lig@@ ently, how could the fact that any amount of Chin@@ es@@ e-@@ made products have pil@@ ed up in the ports within a very short space of time be over@@ look@@ ed?
You mentioned that there are com@@ pen@@ di@@ ums of information.
You yourself said that time is running out.
You should therefore have received this statement by e-@@ ma@@ il.
You gave the floor to a man five times in a ro@@ w.
You have given the example of the distrib@@ ut@@ or in Amster@@ dam who could open a b@@ ran@@ ch in London.
Just now, you listed the measures you have taken in the past nine months.
You have listed clear criteria for when you will do that.
You have listed all the countries in the worl@@ d: how can you forget Chechny@@ a?
You should have received in the last few days a copy of the message from the UN Secret@@ ar@@ y-@@ General to mark the occas@@ ion.
You have worked carefully, you have made the best of an un@@ satisfactory situation that is not primarily of your mak@@ ing.
You have also said that so@@ on, you will table fresh proposals in order to put an end to the concentration of power in the energy distribution.
You also asked for a specific impact assessment before the removal of the bl@@ ending pro@@ hibi@@ tion.
You have f@@ ans in the vis@@ itor@@ s' g@@ aller@@ y, but unfortun@@ ately, they are not permitted to appl@@ aud@@ .

Maybe you p@@ ick@@ ed up a book@@ , a piece of liter@@ ary be@@ aut@@ y which you only find in quality public@@ ations.

You say that it is not effective, that it is not working properly and that the term of office should be exten@@ ded.
You say you have used tw@@ o, so you have two lef@@ t, if that is the case.
You say: '@@ look at refuge@@ es'.
You are divi@@ ding the world into two.
You set an example.
This gives the impression that, so f@@ ar, four or five months have gone by and all the Council has really done is to read the regul@@ ations.
You even write in your docum@@ ent, I quot@@ e: '@@ The signs of recovery are clear@@ '.
You are using other Memb@@ ers' speaking time.
You even make a very question@@ able as@@ ser@@ tion.
You have 35@@ 0@@ .
So clos@@ e, inde@@ ed, that on Fri@@ day I know you will take very atten@@ tive note of how the WTO pan@@ el dec@@ ides on the hormone question, and will definit@@ ely ensure during the presidency of the Council that the European Union ad@@ he@@ res to its pro@@ hibition of hormone and growth enhanc@@ ers.
You have already mentioned it several times.
You have tw@@ o, could you try the other one.
To that ext@@ ent, you are also responsible for it.
You have been informed of them.
You had the proof of that a few days ago.
You had a perfect example of that with the new restrictions and b@@ ans on herbal and alternative medicines which came in a couple of weeks ago.
You have benef@@ ited a great deal from them, my friend@@ s!
You have mentioned some progress and I will return to that.
C@@ lear@@ ly, you have already put up with enough of that today.
You have the right to do so after all@@ !
You have one of them, for example, in the shape of the Swe@@ de, that is tru@@ e.
You have used two.
You are aware of this too.
You will conclude that that is the area in which a reduction in aid can be best and most rapidly achieved.
You will agree that enough is enough.
The responsibil@@ ities of the Member States are another important el@@ ement.
You know this very well.
You@@ , Italy, are a clear example.
You in particular should be more re@@ tic@@ ent, Mr L@@ ang@@ en.
You will get used to it and you will find it does not s@@ add@@ en you too mu@@ ch.
You solve one and new ones can easily come along to take its place.
You get a f@@ ant@@ as@@ tic picture of how new materials might be buil@@ t.
You will all feel the effects in your own pur@@ ses and your own accoun@@ ts.
You will be the wat@@ ch@@ man, you will have the entire procedure in your hand@@ s.
You take 1.@@ 9 million off it.
Can you still stand by that stat@@ ement?
This makes you wonder whether these animals were to be transported in a Fer@@ r@@ ari@@ .
And fin@@ ally, you are envis@@ aging Euro@@ dep@@ loy@@ ment.
You are considering priv@@ ati@@ z@@ ation, deleg@@ ating to third parti@@ es.
You see them all over the place, you see them in Americ@@ a.
What you are doing is con@@ ning people@@ ; it is a s@@ ca@@ m and the people are finding you out.
You try and catch them@@ ; you try and ta@@ g them@@ ; you try and follow them.
You believe that the political risk of revis@@ ing the Treaty is greater than the legal risk of the further procedures.
You are thus acting as ac@@ complic@@ es in this process.
Ob@@ vi@@ ously you have been spe@@ eding through things at an ex@@ traordinary rate and Mr L@@ ink@@ oh@@ r must have been under the mis@@ ap@@ preh@@ en@@ sion that he was not required until 10 p.m.
You recently vis@@ ited Ireland - you have your Irish scar@@ f on@@ !
The Austri@@ ans joined when the scheme was already operational and soon began to use the special production methods dict@@ ated by these environmental requirements as a c@@ ac@@ he@@ t of quality for marketing purpos@@ es.
You know what is needed.
You are aware of the inter@@ min@@ able discussions about how to re@@ patri@@ ate the refuge@@ es, with the F@@ D@@ L and the HC@@ R at log@@ ger@@ head@@ s.
Do you agre@@ e?
Yet you are checked onto the aircraf@@ t, you have to have a boar@@ ding pass with your name on it and the air@@ line is responsible for chec@@ king that the name on the pass is yours.
You are like the amph@@ is@@ ba@@ en@@ a that was so de@@ ar to C@@ é@@ sa@@ i@@ re.
You are completely c@@ raz@@ y.
You say that you are against war@@ , but you would not be the first war@@ mon@@ ger to swe@@ ar that.
Do you agre@@ e?
You are in a Parliament that is very much al@@ ive.
You are perfect ho@@ sts.
You are all bu@@ ff@@ o@@ on@@ s!
You are Cel@@ ts - me to@@ o@@ !
You are ir@@ responsib@@ le@@ !
You are nation@@ alis@@ tic@@ ; you are bul@@ ly@@ ing; you are threat@@ en@@ ing; you are anti-@@ democ@@ rati@@ c@@ ; you are a complete show@@ er!
You have become the face, the symbol and the adv@@ oc@@ ate of it.
You are on your own side but not on our@@ s.
You are standing with your back to the wall and with a p@@ ist@@ ol pointing at your ch@@ est.
You are as it were our resid@@ ent look@@ out.
You are l@@ ate, very lat@@ e@@ !@@ "
What you are saying is that the market remains more important than the environment.
You are turning the thing on its head@@ , and you know what you are do@@ ing.
You are a cancer exper@@ t, since you were the director of an on@@ col@@ og@@ ical centre before you came here as a Commissioner, so you must be used to what you are hearing now.
You are consist@@ ent.
You are here to survey the sh@@ at@@ tered wrec@@ k@@ age of your broken European dream@@ s.
You are involved in a traffic accident.
There you have a demand for what your legislation should contain@@ .
You are inv@@ ited to att@@ end.
You are the guar@@ di@@ ans of the la@@ w.
You are a fri@@ end of Shar@@ on against Ar@@ af@@ at.
You are Mr @@ Barro@@ so@@ ’s gu@@ ide.
You are in the best position to do this.
Wel@@ come, la@@ dies and gentle@@ men@@ !
Only you know the answer to this secre@@ t.
You are the only candi@@ date.
You are the he@@ irs of S@@ án@@ d@@ or M@@ á@@ ra@@ i.
You are the just like the pac@@ if@@ ists and commun@@ ists of 19@@ 38 who supported n@@ az@@ ism and urg@@ ed the al@@ lies and the French to des@@ ert in that war@@ .
You are the he@@ irs of Im@@ re K@@ er@@ t@@ é@@ sz@@ .
Are you ill@@ ?
You are like Mic@@ he@@ l F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ul@@ t: you believe that history is st@@ atic, you believe in structur@@ alism, with your model of the under@@ dog living in pover@@ ty.
Many of you referred to studies.
You are a new Commissioner so you are not to blame for what has - or has not - been done in the past.
I for@@ give you@@ !
You are with us, and you are answ@@ ering the questions of the Cha@@ mber very well.
You have moved from rejection to a test phase.
You are predic@@ table, consist@@ ent, reli@@ able, and fo@@ ster trust and confid@@ ence.
These clar@@ ific@@ ations can be made later outside the chamb@@ er.
You are as law@@ -@@ ab@@ id@@ ing as Vic@@ hy@@ !
You remain ster@@ il@@ e.
You are being reac@@ tionary if you cut yourself off from all new forms of technology.
If you do not mind me sa@@ ying, you are like a har@@ d-@@ working ant, who achiev@@ es results little by little while the gras@@ shop@@ pers ch@@ ir@@ ru@@ p and laz@@ e around in the Member States.
You are strong enough.
You are as st@@ ub@@ born on this issue as a deep@@ -@@ sea fisher@@ man.
You are all very welcome to att@@ end.
You are very difficult to convinc@@ e, Mrs in 't Vel@@ d.
You are a last@@ -@@ minute resistance figh@@ ter.
You are a first class Europe@@ an.
You are a public serv@@ ant and this information must be made public@@ ; it must be in the public dom@@ ain.
You are a very pol@@ ite man and we are very gr@@ at@@ eful to you for that, but we could make even faster progress if you did not say '@@ than@@ k you@@ ' after every vot@@ e, but only at the end of the vot@@ e!
You are a punc@@ ti@@ li@@ ous lawy@@ er and you are right to say that if one takes the word '@@ ru@@ le@@ ' in its stric@@ test sen@@ se, there are not hund@@ red@@ s.
You are a poor representative of your country if you allow this sort of thing to go on@@ '.
You are a ter@@ ri@@ fic speak@@ er, and you are very convinc@@ ing.
You are a serv@@ ant, who has now adopted a position on matters that are the business of your ma@@ ster@@ s.
You are, Your Hol@@ iness, an important adv@@ oc@@ ate of dialogu@@ e.
Have you won@@ dered if all the citizens have this facil@@ ity, even if certain international feder@@ ations have comp@@ lied with this and allow these international events to be broad@@ cast free to air@@ ?
You have indeed said what had to be said well within the time alloc@@ ated.
You were the cause of the disorder@@ .
You were already uni@@ qu@@ e.
You were involved in its development, as were many others.
It may be that you still feel sh@@ y, or perhaps you were more anxi@@ ous than you probably will be after some time has passed – although you should always be a little bit afra@@ id@@ !
You and the Commission really ought to go and look at what is available on the market.
You and Mr Bo@@ oth are closer than you thin@@ k.
You and I come from the same country, and we know that experiments led to a 30 per cent reduction in the quantity of material in consumer packaging over approximately three years.
You and your success@@ ors will be mand@@ ated by the Council only on pap@@ er.
You and your country.
You refer to comments in magaz@@ ines, and say you have no evid@@ ence.
You mention changing the criter@@ ia, if necessary.
You are perform@@ ing your work for Europe in a tr@@ uly mom@@ ent@@ ous period.
You have listed the main str@@ ands in your communication which you published in the first week of Sept@@ emb@@ er.
You are showing yourself to be tr@@ ust@@ worth@@ y.
You have also raised some concern@@ s.
If you travel from Brussels to Amster@@ dam by air@@ , you are c@@ overe@@ d; if you travel by co@@ ach, you are not.
You are treating Greece as a scapego@@ at, dict@@ ating measures against the workers, who are not to blame for the crisis, that will ush@@ er in similar measures for other countries.
You are building cast@@ les in the air and your route ma@@ p up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldi@@ ers.
You also comb@@ ine words with action@@ s: you do not just talk about ‘@@ Europe@@ ’ at official events, but you also work every day on specific issues on the European agenda.
You are mistak@@ en.
You show cont@@ emp@@ t for the MEP@@ s' mem@@ ory of events.
En@@ dless imag@@ ination is used to justify the cul@@ ling - yet in re@@ ality, very little imag@@ ination is needed to break away from this fix@@ ation with slaugh@@ ter.
You are enthusias@@ tic, you show your feel@@ ings, you are colour@@ ful in your speech and you use the right wor@@ ds.
Do you have any proposal to mak@@ e?
This would therefore encourage the rise of extre@@ mis@@ m and anti-@@ European nation@@ alism.
You will make your position known to the services.
You should read the agre@@ ement@@ !
So re@@ new your frequent fl@@ y@@ er packag@@ e: Europe has never had a more important product to sell@@ .
You should listen instead to the voice of the people and local commun@@ iti@@ es!
You might do better to put your question to the contr@@ actor and ask if it is going to keep to its schedu@@ le.
You should make sure that you are better in@@ formed, instead of sitting sh@@ uff@@ ling pap@@ ers and smug@@ ly con@@ cluding that on paper everything looks just fin@@ e.
Firstly, some are im@@ possib@@ le@@ ; you make some sugges@@ tions that are im@@ possible.
You thri@@ ve when challeng@@ ed.
You are therefore putting Europe at a dis@@ advantage in two respec@@ ts: in terms of scientific value and also because of the fact that the lines from before 27@@  @@ June 2002 are sold on the open market.
You have in@@ her@@ ited a min@@ e@@ field.
You are sha@@ king your head - but rather than just travelling to mini@@ stri@@ es, you should listen to the discussions on this subject in Europe's c@@ af@@ és and bar@@ s for once.
You igno@@ red referendu@@ m@@ s, you denied referendu@@ m@@ s, and you bul@@ lied the poor Irish into voting a second time.
You are ign@@ oring all these th@@ ing@@ s; in fact, you are developing a b@@ un@@ ker ment@@ ality, and perhaps that is a good thing, because at least it shows that the end is in sigh@@ t!
You can imagine how they rate quality there@@ !
You can immediately imagine the difficulty of monitoring that would involv@@ e.
You stres@@ s, with strong argum@@ ents, the human factor and the correct application of the International Convention on Stand@@ ards of Tra@@ in@@ ing, Cer@@ tification and Wat@@ ch@@ keeping for Se@@ af@@ are@@ r@@ s.
You are completely mis@@ interpre@@ ting the R@@ ul@@ es.
You would go to Germany or Engl@@ and.
You are playing a game with the time@@ table.
The others over there are being a bit qui@@ et for a change, which is a better th@@ ing!
You mentioned it three times.
You can put it down to the fact that this is the first time I have acted as Vice-@@ Presid@@ ent.
You are present@@ ing it or@@ ally.
You will receive it very short@@ ly.
You have cut it by 8.@@ 2% and you have cut environmental policy by a he@@ f@@ ty 28@@ .@@ 2@@ %.
You can find it in the Official Jour@@ n@@ al, L 30, for the year 2005.
You will have it before the end of the year.
You will have notic@@ ed that.
You will have it un@@ condition@@ all@@ y!
It is going to be on your table.
You have confirmed that yoursel@@ ves.
You have demonstrated this in your re@@ ply.
So you have admitted it.
You did it off your own b@@ at.
You did it as the French President, and well done to you.
You did it for restaur@@ ate@@ ur@@ s, and it needs to be done for public services.
You have inv@@ oked it and I would ask that you comply with it.
You have carried it out without any significant problems.
You mentioned it in only one sent@@ ence.
You have placed it four@@ th@@ ; I suggest you move it up a run@@ g or tw@@ o@@ !
You received it enthusias@@ tic@@ ally.
Mr Wal@@ ter, you referred to this in your interven@@ tion: the point is not whether agricultural policy expenditure will be reduced in 2001 in comparison with the year 2000@@ ; the point is what increase is needed.
You yourself classified it as more sex@@ y.
You will understand this and you would certainly objec@@ t - and rightly so - if the Commission were to express an opinion in other cases that are su@@ b j@@ udi@@ ce and where the proceedings have not yet been con@@ clu@@ ded.
You are aware of it. It is available for you to read@@ .
You would describe it as ou@@ tre@@ ach work.
You say so yoursel@@ f, you point it out as a critic@@ ism.
You are legisl@@ ating on the 18@@ -@@ month detention of w@@ ret@@ ched immigr@@ ants, including under@@ -@@ age children, in concentration cam@@ ps where the living conditions cast sha@@ me on human civil@@ isation.
You granted it to him.
You can hear its dr@@ um@@ s, tro@@ mb@@ ones, cre@@ s@@ cent@@ s.
You can follow it and provide a real solution.
You can understand my Gre@@ ek@@ ?
You know this as well as I. It is very f@@ righ@@ ten@@ ing.
Do you know@@ ?
You have mentioned them and they are particularly important.
You have mentioned them all.
You have all read them@@ ; there are fif@@ ty of them in tot@@ al.
Th@@ ink back to that time when it was so - and, what is more, it makes sense.
You know what they are.
You are depri@@ ving them of bo@@ th.
So we inserted into the legislation Article 4 designed to ensure that you cannot place on the market products which cannot be recycle@@ d.
You attack them today as xenophob@@ es.
You attack them as extrem@@ ists, but worst of all, o@@ h worst of all, you attack them three times for being popul@@ ists.
You can find it on the UK Re@@ present@@ ation@@ ’s website.
You will be desc@@ rib@@ ing what is to be dem@@ anded of them, and you have talked to us in terms of an October date.
You tell them that they must either leave volun@@ tar@@ il@@ y, or go to prison and then get de@@ ported after 18 months.
You then gave him more time@@ !
You are missing the targ@@ et.
You also as@@ k, if four@@ -f@@ if@@ ths of all irregular@@ ities take place in the Member States, what is the result?
In this case you have me on your side, but if I were in your position I hope I should have rather more cour@@ age.
You asked how it looks with the G@@ ross National Product compon@@ ent.
You therefore cut me off@@ ; you can pro@@ test.
The next question is, ‘@@ What is this added valu@@ e@@ ?@@ ’
You will say that this is not part of the normal procedure.
You will tell me that situations of growth or short@@ age do not affect everyone al@@ ik@@ e.
You make me feel as@@ ha@@ med.
He@@ re, you are conf@@ using appl@@ es with pe@@ ar@@ s.
I miss you desper@@ atel@@ y!
You yourself can establish whether the qu@@ or@@ um is present.
There will be non@@ e.
You are lying in that respec@@ t!
You may well be known as "@@ BAT@@ man B@@ our@@ l@@ ang@@ es@@ " although I cannot quite see you with a cap@@ e and mas@@ k, we@@ aring under@@ p@@ ants outside your p@@ ants, but you have done an extremely good job on the BAT@@ s!
You will thus assess the t@@ ang@@ ible and visible consequences of the extreme ultr@@ al@@ iber@@ al, ul@@ tra-@@ inter@@ nation@@ alist and ul@@ tra-@@ immigr@@ ation@@ ist economic policy carried out for the past 25 years by the European institutions and the Member States, with France at the hel@@ m.
You are now placing this book on the inde@@ x of free competition because people do not know how to handle it properly.
You also asked me about the le@@ a@@ ks that occurred from the Palestinian side.
Are you mobil@@ ising the extreme righ@@ t?
You show us what to do when someone mov@@ es@@ .'
You show that even in the dark days of rec@@ ession@@ , one can dre@@ am of U@@ top@@ ia.
Are you trying to make fo@@ ols of us by publish@@ ing st@@ u@@ ff like this in the Official Jour@@ nal@@ ?
You do not need to res@@ ort to lip read@@ ing.
You will not get the opportunity to use it tw@@ ice.
You should not have turned it into an announc@@ ement in the sit@@ ting.
You have not given in to the eas@@ i@@ est options or to dem@@ ag@@ og@@ y, and the results are there to se@@ e.
However, you have not answered the second part of the question in which I mentioned Mun@@ ich@@ -M@@ ü@@ h@@ l@@ d@@ or@@ f-@@ Fre@@ il@@ ass@@ ing, which is part of the main line from Par@@ is to Bud@@ ap@@ est and which is particularly important in view of the B@@ av@@ arian chemical tri@@ ang@@ le and for relief of the B@@ ren@@ ner access rout@@ e.
You therefore have no reason to pro@@ test.
So you have no cause for concern.
You have hon@@ oured your mon@@ etary reference values only in the b@@ reac@@ h, and in 26 out of 41 months you have allowed inflation to exceed your target range.
You have never applied the bra@@ k@@ es.
You have not even managed to obtain the other 100 000.
You only mentioned two ab@@ sten@@ tions.
You do not need to ask it again.
You just do not get it, do you@@ ?
You were not sen@@ sible, or at least this Treaty is not sen@@ sible, with ti@@ des of immigrants f@@ lowing in un@@ check@@ ed.
You have not hum@@ ili@@ ated the Chin@@ es@@ e; it is the Chinese who have hum@@ ili@@ ated you.
You did not indicate whether the Council would be available.
You have not over@@ promis@@ ed, but you have got on and deliv@@ ered.
You did not he@@ ed Len@@ in@@ ’s advice.
Your contribution this morning was de@@ void of Euro@@ speak@@ .
You have not notic@@ ed that in the nuclear age, the electric age, strength no longer lies in numb@@ ers, and that, in order to maintain its leading position, France must continue along the path initiated by General de Gaul@@ le.
You will not focus the debate on Egyp@@ t by discus@@ sing six points with Bar@@ on@@ ess A@@ sh@@ ton.
But you are not allowed to participate in any way, whether you express approval or dis@@ approv@@ al.
It must and can only play this role if it can act effectively.
You must ne@@ ver, never give up on this one.
You should not arg@@ ue in this way.
It is not for you to give adv@@ ice, but to order your own govern@@ ments to implement the policies you decide on.
You should not be having to apply.
You must not wal@@ k on a tigh@@ tro@@ pe bec@@ ause, as we all know, tigh@@ tro@@ pe@@ -@@ walk@@ ers are do@@ om@@ ed to fall one day.
You must not only be secret@@ ary of a Security Council whose members are in dis@@ agre@@ ement.
You should not have allowed people in the gall@@ ery to speak@@ , and when these incid@@ ents occurred you should immediately have suspended the sitting and or@@ dered the g@@ aller@@ ies to be cleare@@ d.
It is no good sp@@ ending time on h@@ ob@@ bi@@ es when there is a day@@ ' s work to be done.
You are not t@@ elling the truth@@ !
You will not divide and ru@@ le.
You are not even pre@@ t@@ ending any more.
You are not part of one of the major groups.
You are just allowing all of that!
You do no@@ th@@ ing!
You will only do that if you show these qual@@ iti@@ es: clar@@ ity, lead@@ er@@ ship, hon@@ est@@ y and hum@@ ility.
You will not do what the Americ@@ ans sen@@ sib@@ ly did in a similar crisis, which is to pass a Gl@@ ass@@ -@@ Ste@@ ag@@ all Ac@@ t, to increase the bank@@ s' capit@@ al, put a check on the con@@ du@@ it banks and reduce the systemic risk@@ s.
You cannot get the foot of Ch@@ arle@@ mag@@ ne@@ ' s mother@@ , Ber@@ the au gr@@ and pi@@ ed (@@ Ber@@ the B@@ ig@@ -@@ Fo@@ ot@@ ), into C@@ inde@@ rel@@ la@@ ' s s@@ lip@@ per.
You negoti@@ ate with third country partner@@ s; you set the terms of co@@ operation.
Ne@@ ither will you play Un@@ cle Sc@@ ro@@ og@@ e as Germany plays that par@@ t.
He would not have been interrupted by you.
You did not even take it up.
You have not done so, and you will therefore not have neutr@@ ality.
You did not even use the full five minutes you were entitled to, which is greatly to your cred@@ it.
You have stri@@ p@@ ped them not just of money@@ ; you have stri@@ p@@ ped them of their democrac@@ y.
You did not know this and now you have been made aware of it.
You are not changing them in order to give citizens the answers they are waiting for.
But there will be no appl@@ ause if you continu@@ ally issue the kind of statements in which you mention all the things which have been decided but not actually implemented.
So you have done them no favour@@ s.
You are not margin@@ aliz@@ ing young people at the bottom of the social lad@@ der, you are margin@@ aliz@@ ing the ment@@ ality of a whole section of society which rejec@@ ts the idea that, when there is a problem, the only solution is a re@@ pres@@ sive one.
I did not receive a response during that sit@@ ting, but you did organ@@ ise the summit@@ .
Is that not possib@@ le?
You will not hear of them in the future ei@@ ther, because they have either been sh@@ ot@@ , assass@@ inated or put to death, or they have dis@@ appe@@ are@@ d.
You are not investig@@ ating it.
You never think of this when you b@@ ite on your pr@@ aline and you discuss whether or not the chocol@@ ate is adul@@ ter@@ ated by the ingredi@@ ents.
Do you believe that in all these cases no results have been achiev@@ ed?
"@@ Don@@ ' t you have good pension@@ s@@ ?@@ "
You would not give Europe the sligh@@ test possibility of developing this type of research, which is worth@@ whil@@ e; you would not allow Europe to move from embryo lines to existing stem cell lin@@ es.
So@@ on there will be nothing left that you can e@@ at@@ !
You cannot to@@ t up pain.
You cannot have bo@@ th@@ !
You cannot have the one without the other.
In the European Union you cannot market a substance that is not allowed to be marketed in the European Union.
You cannot go on like that!
You cannot then get ang@@ ry at Mo@@ ody@@ 's. You will only have yourself to get ang@@ ry at in that case.
You cannot be surpris@@ ed, therefore, that this was com@@ ing.
You cannot give the country a greater sense of identity by erec@@ ting a stat@@ ue of A@@ lex@@ and@@ er the Gre@@ at in every square or by call@@ ing the airport after A@@ lex@@ and@@ er the G@@ reat@@ .
You can only give any real weight to your policy if you dis@@ regard re@@ ality.
You cannot be a terrorist by night and a politic@@ ian by day.
You cannot use it at the same time for des@@ k@@ top PC@@ s and mobile ph@@ ones, but it is possible for all hand@@ -@@ held devic@@ es.
You cannot even build a sh@@ ack@@ .
You cannot even build a ski h@@ ut in Ar@@ l@@ berg am L@@ ech – or rather L@@ ech am Ar@@ l@@ berg – to sing sea sh@@ anti@@ es in of an even@@ ing.
You cannot build a beautiful house with differen@@ t-@@ shaped br@@ ick@@ s.
You cannot force scientists to produce findings within a particular time@@ fra@@ me.
You cannot request it al@@ one@@ ; you need the support of 29 Members of the Hou@@ se.
A pro@@ sec@@ ution system cannot be developed without at the same time developing a defence system, a data protection system, and a rights guarantee system.
Can you tell these mad@@ men to keep qui@@ et@@ ?
You cannot stop it any more than the un@@ il@@ ateral withdrawal from Israel c@@ oul@@ d.
It cannot be defined once and for all.
You cannot obtain everything you w@@ ant.
You should not forget that animals aged over 30 months are now excluded from the food chain both for human and animal consumption.
You cannot face both ways at the same time, no matter how hard you tr@@ y.
You cannot do it in this way.
C@@ os@@ me@@ tic, medical and other products cannot be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous.
Your reply can only be y@@ es.
You can@@ not, however, expect me to be jum@@ ping for jo@@ y, since the line I take diff@@ ers from the one you have just put forward.
You can only do that through a director@@ ate.
C@@ oul@@ d@@ n't you have taken a long@@ er, more isol@@ ated rou@@ te@@ ?
There is only one direct course of action which you take.
You are not just under@@ taking an act of consumption that is good in terms of the content of what you con@@ su@@ me.
You do not look at your feet when you run in a forest@@ .
You will not resolve this crisis with less Europe.
You will not achieve market reform with those bul@@ l@@ do@@ zer tac@@ tics.
It is not this way that you will un@@ ite a Europe which provides an altern@@ ative, the Europe of Al@@ ti@@ er@@ o Sp@@ in@@ el@@ li@@ , of Alc@@ ide De G@@ as@@ peri@@ , of Kon@@ ra@@ d Aden@@ au@@ er rather than of Er@@ ich Ol@@ len@@ ha@@ u@@ er or his other cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary nation@@ alis@@ tic social democr@@ at ri@@ v@@ al.
You will not know where it will be in the tex@@ t, but it will be there.
You will not be the director as Wal@@ t Dis@@ ney is Americ@@ an.
You would not be in office if we had not given you our bl@@ ess@@ ing.
Inde@@ ed, you only support the results that su@@ it you.
You ign@@ ore the vo@@ ters, you are destro@@ ying democrac@@ y, and you have shown that you will stop at no@@ thing.
You are not even following the line taken at the T@@ amp@@ ere Counc@@ il.
You are not in a strong position if you are alone when storm@@ s are r@@ aging in the world.
You are not the centre of the univer@@ se!
You are not John@@ , Du@@ ke of B@@ ed@@ for@@ d, Mr @@ Balk@@ en@@ end@@ e is not Bis@@ ho@@ p C@@ au@@ ch@@ on and Mr @@ Ch@@ ir@@ ac is not Jo@@ an of Ar@@ c. That is old Europe.
You do not have to char@@ m them.
You do not have to hu@@ g them.
You are not accoun@@ table and there is no mechanism for the peoples of Europe to remove you.
You will know that has caused understand@@ able public reaction during past animal health cris@@ es.
As you know, every spring a total of 400 000 cattle are driven on to the Al@@ ps in Italy, Austria and Germany, where they remain for the summ@@ er, i.e. for about three months.
As is well known, Austria is a holiday dest@@ ination both in summer and in w@@ inter@@ , and year by year, seas@@ on by seas@@ on, we have the same experience of a few weeks when the hot@@ els and gu@@ es@@ thous@@ es are full up and there is gri@@ d@@ lock on the stre@@ ets.
As you know, the Council has already banned - in 1990 - the placing on the market and the use of B@@ ST on da@@ iry co@@ ws under Council Decision 90@@ /2@@ 18@@ /E@@ EC@@ .
As you know, the Irish and UK authorities have revealed fra@@ u@@ dul@@ ent practices designed to artific@@ ially increase the weight of poul@@ tr@@ y-@@ meat by adding water and protein to other ingredi@@ ents.

You will not secure support for su@@ pran@@ ational solutions if you claim the credit for common successes and blame Brussels for every ill@@ .

You ann@@ oun@@ ce an ag@@ ency, but you keep the money.

You have expl@@ ained to us what you have done and what responses you awa@@ it.
You told us that we would be a pow@@ er, but in order to be a power you have to have the strength to resist@@ , for example to resist the Hel@@ m@@ s-@@ Bur@@ ton La@@ w which is str@@ ang@@ ling Cub@@ a or to resist the emb@@ arg@@ o which is str@@ ang@@ ling Iraq@@ , but resistance is not one of your qual@@ ities.
You tell us that you are trying to be open but that you have limited room for man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ re.

You will be mis@@ sed.
You will do us a serv@@ ice, and you will do a service to the Europe in which you believ@@ e.
No one can acc@@ use you of doing things by hal@@ v@@ es: 17 fr@@ anc@@ s tax on a litre of w@@ ine, but a mere 6.@@ 50 fr@@ anc@@ s on a litre of be@@ er!
You did not answer them.
You yourself no longer believe any of this@@ !
Don@@ 't you think so@@ ?

Tal@@ k about un@@ fair competi@@ tion!

You think you are enlarg@@ ing the EU emp@@ ire by this ill though@@ t-@@ out polic@@ y.
Do you really think that guidel@@ ines, '@@ flag@@ ship@@ s' and all manner of things that you dre@@ am up and which keep you bus@@ y for hours and days at a time will enable you to provide employment and give confidence to the people of Europe@@ ?
You are wast@@ ing time.
You will lose some fri@@ ends in the upper ec@@ hel@@ ons, but you will gain in terms of people@@ ’s confidence in you and in terms of support for European co@@ operation.

Perhaps you could put the question to the Commission in the normal way.
You may well ask why this is so.

You are allowed to dri@@ ve, no one is stopping you from doing so, and no measures are taken.
You may consider that it acts too slow@@ ly, or that it acts too fast@@ ; that there is not enough condition@@ ality, that there is too much condition@@ ality.
