# Neural-Machine-Translation
Neural machine translation (NMT) is an approach to machine translation that uses an artificial neural network to predict the likelihood of a sequence of words, typically modeling entire sentences in a single integrated model. We will implement a NMT model to translate between English and French respectively.
