The signs are there already in the structures and relations concerning translations, and these are the results.
The signs are encouraging.
The signs are worrying.
The similarities between both these systems do not necessarily lead to arguments about their compatibility.
There are similarities with the European Galileo programme.
The story is similar to that of the European company.
Simple practical matters such as how to store drugs safely and how to administer or take drugs are crucial.
CRSs occupy a powerful position, both in the field of marketing and in marketing information.
Landfill sites are a source of many poisonous substances, and biological wastewater treatment plants cannot purify the waste coming from them, as the bacteria themselves get poisoned.
The EU’s own web sites have contained extremely little information about this summit.
In contrast, the starch-production facilities have adapted well.
The sites identified as being at risk include Berrow Dune and the River Yeo.
Natura sites are not no-go areas where human activities and economic development are to be excluded.
The DOLCETA and EURÓPSKY DIÁR websites should receive more promotion.
Nor are the European Union's websites and documents accessible in suitable formats to people with disabilities, especially the visually impaired.
The websites must be not only multilingual but registered in all languages.
Where there is abnormality, it is because of the terrorism.
The situations in the Member States differ, as has emerged from this study.
Conflicts between us can be counted on the fingers of one hand.
Tragic events such as the one that took place in Dover last June or those that have come to light following the successful 'Cathedral' police operation are situations that no democratic society can tolerate.
Situations outside an airline's control cannot be foreseen.
Extraordinary situations require clear joint action.
The scenarios can vary a great deal.
There are different situations in the different Member States. In some Member States, there are chiropractors, practitioners of different types of massage, non-medical practitioners, acupuncturists, and so on; and patients from other Member States must be provided with access to their services if they so wish.
The situations are very different: the money has a different value.
The six votes against included those of the Czech Republic, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
Snus might not cause lung cancer, because it is not inhaled, but it has effects and causes problems.
Societies must learn.
European companies, such as Vodafone and French Telecom, have had a strong presence in Egypt and in killing the connections by flipping the switch and shutting Egypt down.
Free societies have but one way of dealing with those who use terror and private ‘justice’ as their weapon, and that is to reject them out of hand.
Those societies that have tried to be exclusive and to keep out everybody else have tended to stagnate and atrophy.
Sociologists and demographers all agree that it is the family that binds together a social system.
Outpatient treatment now presents no problems for the citizens of the EU and inpatient treatment has become much simpler.
Basic care must be less expensive and access to medicines more affordable.
Teeth, glasses and personal care fall somewhere in between.
Healthcare is after all a specific sector requiring a specific approach.
Healthcare and education have become impossible.
Health care and care of the elderly, whilst an important part of the overall health system, does not necessarily represent the overall health system.
Health care and care for the elderly are examples of areas in which the EU should only have limited competence.
Highly specialised healthcare has evolved asymmetrically, with the development of centres of excellence in certain countries for rare or chronic diseases which are not common in that specific place but require specialisation.
Health care, childcare and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas that are not directly cross-border.
Healthcare should never be treated as a commercial market service.
Healthcare should not be a commodity.
Health care is not simply a commercial product or service that is traded within the free market.
Healthcare is a national competence, but there are points of contact with Europe.
Healthcare is and must remain a national prerogative.
The added value of cross-border health care is also evident for people seeking highly specialised treatment, which only a very limited number of practitioners in Europe can provide.
The health care in question is a treatment that must be given to a person who resides temporarily in another country's territory, so that this person is not in danger of death and forced to return prematurely to his country of origin in order to receive the necessary health care.
Healthcare, and health itself, are commodities which a part of the population is finding it increasingly difficult to afford.
Parental care is not a luxury for a child, but a natural standard.
The care a child receives in the earliest years will have an impact on him or her throughout life.
Psychiatric care requires more immediate attention: living conditions for patients are poor and budgetary resources, as was implied, are limited.
American soldiers in KFOR were warned against breathing in depleted uranium.
There are not enough MONUC soldiers.
The units of about 100 troops, most of them Nigerian, fought off the first attack before falling back to trenches, firing through the night until their ammunition ran out.
The Iraqi soldiers had broken every single bone in that man' s body.
Bulldozers were sent in to raze houses to the ground and, to make certain that under no circumstances could anything living be found or a single body dug out, tanks were subsequently sent in so that there was little more than a broad road where the houses had been.
The Serbian troops who were initially withdrawn have long since returned.
Nominal balances can therefore be affected by worsening economic conditions. However, they can only fluctuate according to those same economic conditions.
The strong safeguard measures allow the acceptance of the findings of the other competent authorities to be suspended or the Agreement to be terminated should this become advisable.
Soil nurtured by farmers retains its fertility, but when it is deprived of this care it turns into a desert.
Soil that is not used for agricultural purposes soon becomes degraded.
The soil also performs many other important functions: it is a substrate for human activities, along with towns and infrastructure, and also for nature and valuable landscapes.
Soil is a farmer's most precious asset.
The soil is living, it absorbs CO2, it produces biomass: it must be safeguarded, it must even be improved, because European soil is particularly polluted.
Soil varies enormously but it should be living and renewing.
Short-term solutions are not an answer to the widespread and deep-rooted problems of Roma.
Active solutions, such as 'Brake Assist', have the advantage over passive safety systems that they also prevent a great deal of additional adverse effects of accidents, such as hold-ups, traffic jams and non-material harm, that cannot be limited by applying passive safety systems.
Are the solutions that have been reached better than those of the first reading, or has the legislation simply been diluted and further weakened in the course of the six 'trialogues'?
Expensive solutions are not always the most effective.
The CIA’s solutions are unsustainable, both in the short and the long term and for both the EU and the rest of the world.
The peace process often grinds to a halt because unexploded bomblets close off whole areas.
Solutions should include restricting the scope of the transferred data and listing the types of data that the designated providers are able to filter and extract, as well as the types of data which may be included in a transfer.
Yesterday’s solutions are no longer an option.
Diplomatic solutions must be preferred to an escalation of violence and other outrages.
The solutions must, therefore, be international and global.
'E'-solutions provide the possibility of participation with minimal effort: there are no queues or officials exercising the right of discretion.
European solutions are needed.
A comprehensive, systemic solution is often defeated by details or even by lobbying interests.
There is no long-term military solution.
Military solutions have never lasted in Aceh.
The solutions are only effective inasmuch as they are interdependent.
The solutions are not yet fully mature, but there are certainly already some practical steps which can be taken quickly.
However, the solutions are not simple, and we should not overact.
The solutions range from optimising the use of existing capacity to perhaps revising the regulations on slots.
The potential solutions are acknowledged: regionalisation of management for greater flexibility, more accurate scientific evaluation of resources to avoid disputes, greater involvement of the profession ?
The solutions proposed on summoning people, on the rules for the representation of defendants and on retrials or appeals must be read in conjunction with one another.
There are a variety of solutions.
So, the solutions are on the table.
Technical solutions can vary a great deal.
Solvents are one of the main causes of ozone formation, and this has serious consequences, first of all for public health: respiratory diseases and breathing problems can be ascribed to emissions of volatile organic compounds.
The sums in question sometimes defy belief.
Investments that do not bring a value added element with regard to the environment mean less investments that are of benefit to the environment.
The sums paid out were often greater than in the period before the 'blockade'.
The EU-LAC summit meetings are not just events where eloquent statements are made and grand designs are announced but never materialise.
Opinion polls (Food Centre) and surveys (in the Saturday 2 December edition of the Algemeen Dagblad) show that nearly half of all parents are in favour of restricting or banning aggressive advertising.
Opinion polls, whatever questions are put, can sometimes tend to make you feel queasy.
Eurobarometer surveys show that 81% of Europeans back the use of an organ donor card, but only 12% of them actually carry one.
The regular Eurobarometer surveys suggest that these visits are effective in promoting awareness of the European Ombudsman, which often increases after a visit.
Opinion surveys have shown that large sections of the population are opposed to EMU, especially in Sweden.
Alarm bells are ringing and they cannot be ignored.
Non-pathogenic multi-resistant strains of bacteria also represent a risk in view of the possibility of transgenic transfers and, according to the latest research, shared resistance.
No deadlines have been met by the Sudanese.
The resulting tragic human suffering continues, with hundreds of thousands of poverty-stricken refugees, thousands of malnourished and dying children, and the reported emergence in the region of contagious diseases like cholera and hepatitis.
Suspicions on that score are rife.
Sources of nanoparticles released into the environment include:
Livelihoods and biodiversity suffer as a result of overexploitation of wildlife for food.
The non-traditional sources have a lower concentration of the raw material than the traditional deposits.
By-products, such as straw, parings and waste in general, would be used in their production.
By-products in the first and second categories should be traceable through the use of dyes or odorants and should be prohibited.
By-products approved as food and by-products not approved as food must not, for example, be dealt with in the same building.
The pimps were arrested in the same operation.
Diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, heart disease and even cancer have yet to be fully challenged by the biotechnologists.
Experts, however, do call for strategic vaccination in the event of an outbreak, obviously accompanied by failsafe registration.
I have consulted specialists who confirm that taking vitamins and minerals orally presents virtually no health risk.
Most fiercely debated were the specifications for sulphur and aromatics.
The technical specifications were published on 5 August 2002, and the date for entry into force was set, in the normal way, at 5 August 2004.
The specificities of hotel- or restaurant-reservation contracts have also been safeguarded, which was not the case with the initial proposal.
The spectres of Frankenstein and the Polish plumber should disappear from European consciousness and be replaced by trust, freedom and solidarity.
'Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise.
The speculators are stuffing themselves on taxpayers' money and are clearly set to bleed them dry.
The speculators will then turn their attention to Italy, to the UK and to Spain.
Speculation about the origins of individual animals remains rife.
PFOS and PFOS-related substances are highly fluorinated and extremely difficult to break down.
PFOS, a halogenated hydrocarbon, is toxic to humans, and also both carcinogenic and mutagenic.
Mercury sphygmomanometers used in the treatment of high blood pressure or arrhythmia do not have an equivalent substitute capable of equal accuracy, and alternative methods would be extremely expensive.
Sphygmomanometers are, in any case, used only in certain medical applications, and are absolutely indispensable in certain medical situations in which measurements are required to be of the utmost exactitude.
Spirits made from bananas, for example, rather than from potatoes, cereals or molasses, should not be called banana vodka, but banana drink or banana spirit.
Sponsors can exercise pressure on clubs.
Lead stabilisers, in other words organotin and lead compounds, are the most relevant ones and the environmental risks are higher, especially in the case of lead stabilisers.
The automatic stabilisers will be more effective if the slowdown is greater than anticipated.
Petrol stations are dry.
Authorised service stations, too, must have the right to buy parts from independent producers, as well as the tools and equipment used in their workshops.
Energy statistics are like the steel rods holding up a building: you cannot see them from the outside but without them the whole building collapses.
Statistics show that mutual trade is growing sharply and flourishing.
Statistics have to be comprehensive, reliable and consistent.
Statistics on the number of people diagnosed with dementia reveal the enormity of the problem.
That is clear from Eurostat statistics: it was approximately 90% in both 2007 and 2008.
The statistics provided by international organisations are appalling - they say that around 150 000 Christians are murdered worldwide every year.
Statistics show that the alternative solutions have caused many deaths in the workplace.
Statistics show that one person out of every five above the age of 80 suffers from Alzheimer's disease.
Statistics show a steadily increasing number of reports to all hotlines.
It will be clear from the appended statistics how dire is the situation of women in developing countries as regards their reproductive health and the continuing high death rates among infants, children and their mothers.
The most recent statistics still indicate not only an increase within the EU of the number of new HIV infections, but also a large proportion of HIV infections which are still undiagnosed.
There are statistics showing that this disease results in a huge loss of population mainly of working and retirement age.
The statistical surveys show that the spread in deficit and growth levels is too wide as well as demonstrating a correlation between high deficits and low growth rates.
The statistics show that the programme only alleviates the problem of malnutrition but is not eliminating it.
Statistics show that products of unknown origin notified through Rapex were, for the first time, down to 3% in October 2007, as compared to 17% in 2006.
Statistics show that products of unknown origin notified through RAPEX were down for the first time in October 2007, standing at 3% as compared to 17% in 2006.
Statistics show that around one in three young Europeans has tried an illicit drug and at least one of our citizens dies every hour from a drug overdose.
The statistics provide no information on the extent to which the recorded increase in reported cases of domestic violence is related to the increased willingness of the victims to stand up for themselves or what proportion of these are immigrants.
Therefore, the statistics often do not provide us with the relevant information about how many people are seriously ill, how many suffer and how many die as a result of this illness.
These statistics are not comparable between different countries and are difficult to interpret.
The statistics speak for themselves, as Commissioner Reding is well aware: the age at which children access the Internet has dropped considerably.
The figures from the World Health Organisation's latest research show that the percentage of carriers of the virus remains at the same level, whilst the number of new cases has fallen.
The statistics on Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are extremely worrying, such as the fact that every year, 1.4 million citizens living in the European Union develop some kind of dementia and a new case is diagnosed every 24 seconds.
The statistics are alarming, above all, with regard to Italy, where the average payment is made at 186 days, peaking at 800 days in regional government with regard to the health sector.
The statistics are rather frightening.
The statistics are horrifying.
One of these is provided by quarterly statistics on job vacancies in the Community.
What the report calls 'stereotyping' may be just a quick way to link a product to a particular group of consumers.
A person is then driven by biological stimuli from the subcortex region of the brain that are not checked or controlled by the cortex, where the higher emotions are based.
Are the storehouses safe?
Stocks were declining because of the setaside.
Stocks of elvers wax and wane even if there is a downward overall decline.
Cereal stocks in the EU have been reduced.
Good examples of some success can be seen in stocks such as saithe, North Sea haddock and mackerel, which are fished close to MSY level and which are generally stable and profitable.
Stocks of herring and sprat continue to be very healthy.
Stocks of blue and white marlin are severely depleted in the Atlantic and they do need protection.
Stocks of deep-sea fish are, however, very sensitive in biological terms, as they have a very low breeding rate and grow very slowly - substantially more slowly than other types of fish.
The intervention stocks at the end of the budgetary year are likely to be no more than about 2 million tonnes, consisting mainly of rye and barley.
The stockpiles were so high that they would last worldwide for two years.
The stores down there are empty.
The estimated global stocks are 1.3 million tonnes.
Stocks are high and, as a result, prices for many wines are low and income for wine-growers has been reduced.
Stomatologists in the European Union use 125 tonnes of mercury each year.
Long-term strategies must be put in place to ensure that the poorer and peripheral regions of my country are helped to become competitive in terms of the attraction of business, as well as the improvement of their respective transport and water-treatment services.
The common strategies have not always worked in the way that the Council and others had hoped.
Common strategies are being developed, the caterpillar tracks are being brought out and put on.
Consequently, strategies and measures to improve OSH must be specifically adapted to particular workplaces, taking into account the fact that some factors might affect women and men differently.
The stress tests proposed by the Commission are necessary.
There are not enough facilities for the care of children and other dependents and in general there is a lack of flexibility.
Structures set up for the purpose of helping the cause of the Roma often use this cause as a pretext.
The active substances that are most frequently discovered in concentrations exceeding the EU residue limits should not be marketed any more, because they have thereby proved, I am afraid to say, that they are uncontrollable.
Chemicals are present everywhere, and the recent increase in certain types of cancer or leukaemia has to make us question the use of certain chemicals.
CMR substances, carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic substances have still not been removed from children's toys.
It is the substances contained in hop cones that determine the mellow bitterness, the head, the ease of preservation and the typical aroma of a beer.
Ozone-destroying substances have a deleterious effect over a very long period.
The substances available on the market, although not included in the list of banned substances, are very difficult to control, making it impossible for medical staff to provide assistance as the chemical combinations used have unknown reactions.
The substances in question will therefore be included in the third list of priorities under Council Regulation No 793/93 on the assessment and control of risks associated with existing substances, provided that the precise chemical identity of these substances is established and the producers and importers of the substances are known.
Unwanted substances and products must be excluded in a secure and controlled manner.
The substances which are the subject of this report have clear and demonstrated beneficial properties as flame retardants in materials and products such as foam-filled furniture.
The substances that have been allowed into food must be approved, and active packaging must not be misleading to consumers.
Naturally occurring substances in water must be examined when setting limit values; the high arsenic content of groundwater in the Southern Plains region in Hungary is a good example.
Chemical substances or techniques are used for body care, food and health products.
The fragrances do nothing for the children or for the toy.
The pollutants emitted depend both on the nature of the waste to be treated and the technologies used to treat this waste.
Those chemicals that need to be authorised are not just any old ones.
Substances that pose a risk to health must be withdrawn, and the overall amount of pesticides we use must be reduced.
Substances that cause allergies, not in everyone, but in certain people who cannot resist them, simply have no place in detergents.
Substances considered dangerous in one country may have a different regime in another country.
For instance, will toxic substances migrate into the air and will people living in neighbouring countries, such as Slovenia, be in any danger if they inhale them?
EU subsidies have even been adjusted accordingly.
EU subsidies have nevertheless been widely used to encourage concentration of abattoir capacities.
A further bone of contention is the area direct payments.
Subsidies must be examined for their effectiveness and changed or replaced by other measures if necessary.
Subsidies should be channelled into these areas and not into short-term support determined by fluctuating oil prices.
Subsidies make for inefficiency and increase costs.
Subsidies are not the best way of doing so, as they are mere drops in the ocean.
The subsidies will be discontinued, but this will be carefully managed, taking into consideration both jobs and the environment.
Previous subsidies ought, therefore. to be reclaimed.
Funds are granted by the Commission in accordance with the usual rules.
Subsidies are too bureaucratic: there won't be a penny for the risk-bearing entrepreneur.
The earlier successes of the Daphne programme make it clear that the programme must be continued.
The high points of the historic year of 2004 were followed by a particularly difficult phase.
The fact is that the successes and the credit side of the Rose Revolution in Georgia have been tarnished in recent months and years by a good few authoritarian decisions which have encroached on the powers of the judiciary.
The successes that have been achieved cannot make their impact felt when corruption is unchecked, the law is unstable, and long overdue reforms are not carried out.
The successes of populist parties across Europe demonstrate that the spark can all of a sudden ignite.
The subjects of both reports are related.
Topics should be interlinked.
These are difficult issues.
Perfluorooctane sulphonates (PFOS) are toxic, persistent and bioaccumulative substances present in applications such as chromium plating, waterproofing and fire resistance.
The super-credits to manufacturers producing LCVs with emissions of CO2 of less than 50g CO2/km will be limited with a threshold of 25 000 LCVs per manufacturer;
Supermarkets frequently stay open until 10 p.m. on weekdays, and sometimes even round the clock.
Nutritional supplements should be subject to the same rules as additive premixes, given that both categories of products generally contain the same proportion of additives.
Nutritional supplements are intended to adjust an animal's nutritional intake in response to a temporary increase in its nutritional requirements brought about by critical breeding or living conditions, such as during calving, weaning or at point of lay.
The removal of the points dealing with the following issues is particularly significant:
Fabrications and speculations persist only in the absence of truth.
Overcapacities must be converted into new work methodically and with an equal division of burdens.
The present excessive talk, like the increased fighting, lead nowhere.
Surfers and divers, for example, are often in the water.
The survivors of the disaster need clean drinking water, which cannot be provided on a sustainable basis without good treatment plants.
Suspects and defendants have rights both as people and as parties to proceedings.
Suspensions and reservations often lead to the necessary improvements.
Symbols and tears are no longer enough.
The national symbols - the flag and anthem - were not changed and are still those of the MPLA party.
The symbols for aluminium, glass and plastic, however, also show 'chasing' arrows, thus indicating to the consumer that the materials are recyclable, and in this way could give misleading information.
The symbols were chosen through the work of the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN).
The intention of the symbols is to indicate to consumers that the packaging can be reused or recycled.
Symptoms include diarrhoea and dehydration.
The symptoms of allergy are triggered by chemicals, natural and artificial food additives, spices, pollen and other natural substances, and animal hair.
The symptoms are different from those caused by the weather, for example, but they coincide with the use of new generations of neurotoxic systemic active substances used for pelleting on large-scale crops close to the hives.
The effects are common but everyone's experience is different.
Trade unionists are prosecuted and sentenced in sham trials.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome has so far attacked 2 416 people of all ages and has caused 89 deaths, mainly in Asia.
ADRs, therefore, cannot be a replacement for legal remedy.
The colonial systems that were established during the 19th century benefited the home country, of course, but they also benefited the colonies.
Capitalization systems can provide a supplement.
This will make safety belt systems compulsory in cars up to 3.5 tons.
Compensation schemes that make behaviour irresponsible: that is toxic.
The supervisory and control systems in the Member States were generally ineffective or moderately effective, and the Commission maintains only a moderately effective supervision of their functioning.'
The supervision and monitoring systems were not yet fully installed, were not yet operating effectively, and payments continue to be largely blighted by errors.
The monitoring systems vary too much and the way the results are presented in the Commission report is too restricted.
Filter systems must become more widespread.
Batch systems can work.
Generation IV nuclear energy systems will allow better nuclear waste management and decrease its quantity.
PNR systems have been evaluated by the authorities in each country.
Tax and benefit systems should be reformed, for example, by reducing excessively high rates of tax for those on low incomes.
Reuse systems have been shown to be beneficial to the environment, provided a minimum number of reuse cycles is achieved and transport distances are not too great.
Health-care systems, especially in the 12 newer Member States, need in many cases a complete overhaul, with attention required to the structural improvement of hospitals, the modernisation of equipment and up-to-date training of health personnel.
Evaluation systems in the form of what are known as ECTS points should be clear, understandable and unified.
Intelligent vehicle systems help to avoid risky situations altogether and, by easing the burden on drivers, are conducive to a more relaxed and foresighted driving style.
The 'support systems for youth' are to receive at least 15%; by this is meant the European Youth Forum and the network of youth organisations and persons active in this field whom it supports.
Systems are being connected and electricity trading is moving at a faster pace, which means that there is an increasing need for timely and more detailed information about electricity flows.
Systems such as adaptive cruise control (ACC), lane-change assistance, and electronic stability control (ESC) are technically well developed and highly reliable.
Systems such as SOLVIT contribute to that.
TACs and quotas only control what is landed, they do not control what is caught.
The tasks to be done must be meaningful and challenging, and a European certificate must be awarded immediately after participation, describing the skills obtained by the participant through voluntary work.
The tasks in this field should and will be performed by the European Ombudsman.
In terms of both work and cooperation this has been a very busy time for me.
The various tasks on the list of priorities should be tackled one by one.
The tasks that they may carry out are the same.
The TAC will be set according to the precautionary approach unless it results in a reduction in the biomass in any given year.
The next stage is the criminal one.
The next step will be to market the very air that we breathe.
The Taliban have scored a notable success only in reducing opium production.
Stalinism and Nazism are two sides of the same ideology.
Charges are generally higher in the cohesion countries than in the more advanced countries of the Union. Similarly, the number of personal computers is lower.
Tattoos, however, are much less satisfactory.
Tattoos can cause problems, they can become difficult to read or they can be altered.
The ill-defined status of Kosovo is a latent source of uncertainty.
The status of Abyei remains uncertain.
The position with regard to peat cannot be determined according to the same standards as biogases, for example.
The Staff Regulations allow the European Institutions to recruit three main types of staff: permanent officials, temporary agents and contract agents.
The status of Kosovo was virtually the same as that of the federal republics.
Legal status has been thus practically evaluated.
In Ireland we have a very high level of abortion, disproportionately high in comparison with other EU countries.
The rates of 15 to 25%, which allow no distinction between immediate necessities and luxuries, the uniform rates which require the poor worker and the rich businessman to pay the same excise and tax toothpaste at the same rate as a yacht, are often higher than the rates at which big business is taxed directly.
There is no doubt that rates of cancer have increased.
The failure rates happen to be much higher than might be expected.
Unemployment rates across the European Union have shot up.
Annual growth rates of the market for GNSS-enabled products and services are estimated to be above 10%.
The financing ratios have to be renegotiated for each new Fund.
The fraud rates in France and Spain are, for example, considered 'suspiciously low'.
That the task is possible is clear from the rates already achieved in some countries.
Rates of sickness have increased dramatically.
Mortality rates while waiting for a transplant usually range from 15% to 30%.
Mortality rates while waiting for a heart, liver or lung transplant usually range from 15% to 30%.
Mortality rate while waiting for a heart, liver or lung transplant usually ranges from 15 to 30%.
Mortality rates among people waiting for a heart, liver or lung transplant are between 15% and 30%, so patients who need an organ transplant will have to wait less time for that operation, thanks to this new directive.
Mortality and morbidity is higher in clones than in sexually-produced animals; the welfare of both surrogate dam and clone can be affected.
There is a high birth rate among the Roma population as well as high rates of adult and infant mortality.
Loss rates currently amount to between 1 000 and 10 000 times higher than the average during the earth's history.
Current recycling rates of PVC packaging are less than 3% in the EU and all of it is down-cycling, which produces inferior quality with no environmental or economic benefits.
Suicide rates, levels of drug use and violence in society are just a few of the symptoms of a global malaise that is spreading.
The risk of dying from it is twice as high in one Member State as in another.
The current execution rates are close to 100%.
The rate of HIV infection is on the increase, and it is estimated that the number of persons with the virus is - as has been said several times over today - three times higher than the official figure.
French rates, British rates or international rates?
Low rates apply on social grounds, employment grounds, and in order to regulate and prevent moonlighting.
The average growth rates on which the Commission has based this will have to be constantly reviewed in the light of the most recent economic data, since annual growth rates can fluctuate considerably over a period of seven years.
Consumption taxes usually have a fair impact, as the richest are also those who consume the most and who therefore pay the most.
Green taxes such as reduced VAT rates can also have a similar effect, by stimulating demand for low consumption vehicles and domestic appliances.
European taxes: a reason for a celebratory cocktail!
Charges can be adapted according to time of day, day, weight and EURO emission class.
Levies on fertiliser surpluses was one method tried, but it did not work to good effect for us.
London taxis are also known for their quality.
The Czechs rightly threw them out of the window in an act known as ''defenestration''.
They also plan trialogues.
They were deported by Stalin.
The Chechens who carried out this operation were not born monsters, but became them.
The Chechens have been the victims of colonial persecution for 150 years.
Techniques continue to develop, including in breeding and cultivation and one new technique is genetic modification.
Drilling techniques have similarities, even if the waters are much shallower in the North Sea.
Thanks to modern ventilation technology, the quality of indoor air can be raised to a level that is even higher than that of the air outdoors.
Technology needs reliable guidelines, rules, not inextricable mazes.
Cyanide-based technology has been used for extracting gold for over 100 years under conditions ensuring the environment's safety and as part of an efficient process for extracting gold.
CCS extracts and buries the carbon from any hydrocarbon source rather than allowing emissions to enter the atmosphere.
Information and communications technology (ICT) is important in all innovative activity.
Information technology would suffer the same fate: with patents, every command, every sequence of codes and algorithms would be protected, and the market transformed into a web of restrictions.
Technology and content cannot be governed by the same legislation: technology must be neutral and content must be regulated.
GSM and GPS technology already exists, and GPS2 is only around the corner.
Telecommunications and media are not crisis-ridden industries; they are an expanding sector.
Telecommunications are already considered to have been liberalised and are therefore not being taken into consideration.
Witnesses were sometimes accompanied by lawyers who ensured that difficult questions remained unanswered.
Temperatures today are below the maxima of the last 2 000 years.
It is a fact that average temperatures are rising and that the number of days with high temperatures and low humidity is also on the increase.
Storms in Spain and Portugal have again left a trail of deaths, injuries and missing persons in their wake.
Perhaps the most impressive temple complex Ggantija in Gozo is in dire need of immediate professional attention.
Driving and resting times, working time and monitoring belong together.
The time taken by the Commission and the Council is not counted, but both of them, I have observed, are careful not to abuse this.
The shorter weekly resting times can now simply be taken in the vehicle.
Times have changed, and responses need to be innovative.
These are new times and a particular feature of new times is that crises mount up and proliferate and are not resolved.
Periods allowed for breastfeeding should be regulated and there should be facilities for breastfeeding at the workplace.
These are tough times and budgets are not limitless.
The trend towards the consumption of frozen fish has had a bearing here; probably it has not been possible to keep pace with the equivalent increase in aquaculture, although aquaculture is responding satisfactorily to a certain growth in the market.
Due to worrying health trends, especially the rise in cancer cases, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity, and despite the improvements in curative medicine, this asset is under increasing threat.
Nationalist tendencies are evident in all sections of the population and there are no measures to oppose the traditional hostilities.
Modified plants may contain higher levels of natural toxins.
Under this system, the residue levels are precautionary levels, not danger levels for the consumer.
Keeping them in from the sun a lot of the time?
Ethnic tension is once again mounting.
Tensions are apparent at the level of global politics.
Tensions are also being aggravated by the fact that these two countries are nuclear powers.
Tensions are running high.
Attempts by governments to suppress the use of certain drugs are as old as their failure.
Attempts to play down the differences between the sexes are another dangerous trend, which has an impact on various aspects of life, sometimes with disastrous results.
Clamping down on attempts to revive Mari national culture and language has continued.
Its attempts to overcome the Church are proving unsuccessful, however, as the number of believers is steadily increasing year on year.
The stereotype that it is a woman's lot to do auxiliary work is well illustrated here.
The political prevaricating of recent weeks has not only damaged Greece.
Adequate and inadequate, in my view, are not particularly appropriate terms to use.
The letter of the law is important and must be controlled, but its application must be equally controlled.
The term 'sexual and reproductive rights' is therefore inappropriate.
The terms of the debate are familiar.
The words of the Dominican Lacordaire are apt here: 'Between the weak and the strong, between the rich and the poor, between the lord and the slave, it is freedom which oppresses and the law which sets free.'
E-europe, e-learning, e-commerce, e-business are on everyone's lips, and are increasingly setting the political agenda.
Working terms and conditions cannot be driven by the situation on the labour market, and availability for work.
The words ‘travel’ and ‘voyage’ should regain their original meanings.
The terms harmonisation and level playing field have been the gateway to a suffocatingly legalistic system.
The terms used most often are economically dependent workers or para-subordinate workers and persons who perform work similar to that of an employee.
Dutch terms such as or may continue to be used to describe cough sweets, since everyone appreciates that these sweets cannot always immediately make the cough disappear.
The terms 'sharing' and 'pooling' describe what is now needed.
The concept of 'reproductive and sexual health and rights' would then have been clearly defined, in terms of the protection of the unborn child, by means of the following wording: 'In the context of this Regulation, abortion, which can never be promoted as a family planning method, cannot be considered as a service which guarantees sexual and reproductive health'.
'Seafaring crew' and 'Schiffsbesatzung' would have the additional advantage over the expression used in the German version, in that 'seemännische' in German still has a very masculine ring to it, whilst 'Schiffsbesatzung' and 'seafaring crew' could be said to be gender-neutral, which would have an advantage in terms of gender mainstreaming.
The terms are 'political power' and 'religious authorities'.
The terms 'light' , 'ultra light' , 'low-tar' and such like, are incorrect.
'WIPO Treaty' should stand, and the following four words plus the parentheses must be deleted.
The words 'trafficking in human beings', 'sexual exploitation' and 'forced prostitution', at both national and global level, encompass the risk of a pandemic similar to that which poverty and hunger have created, mainly in the developing countries, in the lower echelons of these societies.
The name of a ‘Constitutional Treaty’ describes what it is perfectly: it has constitutional elements and it is an international treaty.
The language is hardly suggestive of uniformly severe enforcement. Words like 'proportionate' and 'dissuasive' have been used.
The terms 'veal', 'veal meat', or any other sales description defined in the proposal may no longer be used in the labelling of meat obtained from animals aged more than 12 months.
Agricultural land has been affected, including 75% of the pea crop in the UK.
Rural regions that remain uncultivated become afforested naturally, which is also the case with areas of woodland that have been cut down or burnt.
The land that remains turns into swamp or desert.
The land is also different and this diversity must be respected.
IRA terrorists Monaghan, Connolly and McCauley were duly convicted of training FARC guerrillas in Colombia.
Jihadist terrorists, for example, are suddenly no longer considered dangerous.
The terrorists dragged him over the asphalt into the jungle, and nothing more was heard of him.
The gunmen tied him and his wife to a chair and, as she pleaded for their lives, the Brigade member told her: ' His time has come' .
'Softly, softly' conciliation is merely banked by the terrorists, who then demand more and more.
All the terrorists wanted to attain was chaos and unreasoning revenge.
Terrorists are not heroes, but killers, and must be approached accordingly.
Terrorists are not nourished by religion or ideology.
Terrorists do not fall from the sky.
The terrorists were also killed.
Terrorists are getting more and more ingenious.
Terrorists are specific persons who exist but, at the same time, they are invisible and unseen.
Testing at 30 months remains the norm, but will be kept under review.
the tests being applied should take into account the nuclear technology used at the power plant, which may include special characteristics that it has, without having to use test 'templates';
There are hardly any clinical trials involving the testing of medicinal products on women.
Testing for BSE has been introduced for all healthy animals aged over 30 months and for at-risk and casualty animals over 24 months.
Now that screening tests are compulsory, is it necessary to go on destroying healthy animals or healthy parts of animals?
The stress tests proposed by the Commission will not be enough on their own to pacify the public.
Stress tests are an essential supervisory tool for evaluating the specific solvency of individual banks and the ability of the system as a whole to withstand stress.
Toxicity tests are desirable and cannot be skipped.
The tests should be concluded on 11 November.
Tests should be performed centrally on the most toxic substances in order to obtain reliable data, and these substances should be withdrawn from the market, in particular if they are carcinogenic or harmful to the reproductive system or other systems.
Testing must be reliable, low-cost and accessible to all patients, along with more effective diagnosis and treatment.
The so-called stress tests being prepared will only make sense and credibility in a cohesive Europe will only be restored if these stress tests are performed according to stringent criteria and not according to the weak criteria of the IAO, if genuinely independent experts are consulted and if the events and the entire process is presented to the public in an appropriate and understandable way.
The tests must allow us to better define the potential recapitalisation needs of the banks and to take the measures that you have just mentioned.
Therefore, this assessment also covers the acute and long-term risks to honey bees and their larvae and the tests applied are based on standards developed by intergovernmental organisations such as, for example, the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation, in which 47 governments collaborate.
Laboratory tests have confirmed that 14% of the total number of ill people have contracted the virus and it has claimed one victim.
Scientific testing must be specific, in this case for children, and must be updated.
The testing is paid for by the company.
By testing toys, it can be indicated whether or not this 'acceptable daily intake' is exceeded in the case of humans.
Full and specific tests must be carried out on donated blood and plasma and we must be continually informed of the existence and validity of new viral markers.
Animal tests should only take place as an absolute necessity, and that is not happening in the case of cosmetics.
Knee-jerk legislation, however, is never warranted.
Out-of-date legislation can be repealed. Other legislation can be simplified, and some can be merged and consolidated.
Equally shocking are the texts of anti-Hungarian graffiti.
This would make the essential texts simpler to read and allow the less essential ones to be amended via a less cumbersome procedure.
Textiles are the first stage, and other sectors of production will follow.
The subjects will also have to be selected, however.
Contradictory theories abound, with greater or lesser scientific foundation.
Non-conventional therapies are based on the same natural laws as conventional therapies, but seek to stimulate the body's internal self-healing powers to a greater degree.
Somatic stem cell therapies, which are those that use stem cells extracted from humans after they are born or from the umbilical cord and placenta, are at a tipping point.
The therapies which this regulation seeks to deal with have great potential for treating cancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
The Tibetans embody their own culture in inhospitable living conditions, isolated and high up in the mountains.
The Tibetans are persecuted.
Third parties will need access to this information at the same time as the gateway owners' own services.
Third parties will not get bulk data.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are committing new atrocities, and it is the Sri Lankan Government that decides where.
The Tamil Tigers have their share of the responsibility for these horrors.
The estimate for job creation is an average 1.3 new jobs per SME over 2 years which is described as substantial.
The estimate for the most likely error in cohesion spending was significantly lower than in previous years, and for the budget as a whole, the Court's estimate of errors has fallen over recent years.
The latest estimate puts the number of older people that have suffered abuse at over 10%, which is a staggering figure.
The official estimate of the number of prisoners affected in this specific area and this specific instance is 300, rather than 700.
Human tissues and cells have become an important part of health care.
Tissues and cells are often acquired through cross-border exchanges.
It is possible to store heat in all size categories for a day or a year, as opposed to what is stated in the Commission proposal and in certain committee opinions.
The storage of waste in repositories, however, must in any case be performed in accordance with internationally accepted safety standards, requirements and methodology.
Storage of mercury in an above-ground facility is therefore questionable in terms of safety and in terms of time (the amendments suggest that this storage would be temporary).
The storage and disposal of such data is a crucial part of this safeguard.
There is no possibility of 'proportionality' and 'reciprocity' in the case of bulk data storage and transfer, since it involves a series of uncontrollable dangers, specifically relating to who has access, how the data are used and for what purpose.
The geological storage of carbon dioxide has been identified as a possible solution for mitigating the effects of an increase in the anthropogenic concentration of this gas in the atmosphere.
TEPCO'S stock of anti-radiation suits ran out very quickly.
There are obvious suspicions about the hoarding of meat and bonemeal and about where and how the testing is effected.
The average supply of white sugar accounts for 14% of the production quota of 2 million tonnes.
Estonia was most frequently used as an example and mention was also made of the Russian embargo on Polish meat products.
Estonia is particularly vulnerable to cyber attacks, since it has an e-cabinet and e-government and this year had the first e-elections.
Estonia and Lithuania will receive 52 and 53% respectively.
Estonia is already part of the first wave but has it made sufficient progress in the treatment of its Russian-speaking minority and is Latvia not now overtaking Estonia in this respect?
The tóraidhe were Anglo-Irish people who were expelled from their land on account of their religion.
The swollen streams and rivers carried off everything in their path.
The turtles, the dolphins, would die!
Torture is still the order of the day.
The Touareg in the desert in northern Niger, the Makonde in Tanzania or Mozambique take their families and put their meagre possessions in a little basket if they wish to move.
Mud lagoons dissolve the mercury, arsenic, cadmium, antimony and many other toxic minerals, and channel them via neighbouring streams straight into the Shannon River, only metres away from where the water supply for Limerick City is taken.
Tourists show interest in history, but the tragic, historically significant and even complicated events of recent decades should not be trivialized or presented in a Disneyland or kitsch style.
Tourists come to my coast, for example, for the crabs.
The last few metres are the most difficult and the most strenuous.
The first few weeks of the lives of newborn children are invaluable for the development of trust, sensory-cognitive skills and a bond with both their parents.
Misusers must be given treatment, but use must be punished.
The amount of red tape involved has to be seen to be believed.
Tractors benefit just as much from this clean fuel, which means they produce less pollution.
It ought to be strömming and silaaki respectively, and the same applied for the Appendix.
The necessary translations were not available, either.
There is no problem identifying the parties involved in trafficking child pornography, who are often repeat offenders.
Child traffickers rarely get caught or punished.
The people traffickers and traffickers in women are already prepared for it.
Traffickers are also using Internet recruitment. This is very alarming as many children have access to the Internet.
The traffickers know that information campaigns are hardly likely to change the situation, for studies have shown that most buyers are well aware of the higher concentration of harmful substances in these products and the risk of penalties being imposed.
Tragedies are not fair; almost always, those who have the least are those who lose the most.
The tragedies suffered by Cyprus during the last few weeks are the most serious it has known since 1974; they are the consequence of the tension which has not ceased to increase along the 180 kilometres of the demarcation line.
Freight trains will not therefore be systematically penalised, especially where there is a greater need for speed and/or punctuality.
Trains do not slalom.
Trains can use a greater proportion of renewable energy.
The health care available can vary widely, as can the way in which they are treated by their neighbours from day to day.
Medical treatment, including complicated surgery required by patients with excessively high cholesterol levels, is also more expensive than simple, traditional foods.
Treating them as possible aggressors to be discouraged from approaching our prosperous Europe means that only the well-off will be allowed into this very private club.
There is no such reference in the current Treaties, although they were drafted by Saint Schuman.
The Treaties must be ratified and the measures implemented.
Treaties are to be kept to!
Agreements are not just designed to regulate periods of fine weather; we need them in order to be able to act in times of difficulty and if someone is not being constructive.
The agreements are already in existence.
It is a language into which the treaties are translated.
Journeys become longer, there is more wear and tear to the roads, and there is more pollution.
Transfer targets are becoming younger and younger: a player becomes transferable at the age of 15.
No complex procedures are needed for minor waste shipments, such as waste that originates during travel.
Transfers may however benefit from one of the exceptions in Article 26(1) of the Directive.
They already existed in ancient times: they had them in Roman times, although on a smaller scale.
International radio transmissions have been sabotaged.
Organ transplants are an important means of rehabilitation for patients suffering a multitude of illnesses that cause fatal problems with certain organs.
Transplants are one of the most miraculous achievements of modern medicine, but less than 25% of the UK population are registered organ donors.
Transponders must be secure and it must no longer be possible to disconnect them during flights, as was the case during the attacks on the United States.
Certified hauliers must be given this option.
The carriers too must be involved, as well as the owners of the goods transported.
Transport providers must, moreover, provide basic assistance in case of an accident (food, clothing and medical assistance), and lodging for up to two nights.
Both carriers and shippers recognised that the most recent study by Global Insight was of a high standard and that its results were based on thorough research.
Foreign hauliers work in the UK on fuel brought with them in 1 000-litre tanks.
Road carriers need specially equipped parking areas where drivers can rest under conditions of complete safety, as well as their vehicles and carried goods.
The transport of animals is characterized mainly by the cruelty, immorality and unethical treatment animals are forced to go through.
Transportation by road is the most common and the fastest growing means of travelling and of transporting articles and goods, but also the most dangerous.
It is transported many times, the link with the original breeder is broken and traceability becomes unreliable.
Could a start not be made on transposing the dozens and dozens of directives?
Traumas from the present as well.
Countless psychological traumas are another legacy of these exposures to violence.
Older workers will see young people as their competitors.
American workers change professions an average of three times during their lifetimes.
Chinese workers work six long days a week.
These workers were exposed to radiation levels three thousand times above the permitted levels.
Workers in Mladá Boleslav earn less than their counterparts who assemble Audis or Citroëns; is that social dumping too?
Employees should be a part of the restructuring process. They should be able to be involved with it and influence it.
Workers must be made more greatly aware of the need for ongoing further training.
Workers must be clear about how to protect themselves and others.

Selfemployed people currently make up only 16% of the working population.
Lay-offs should be a last resort: intelligent work-sharing and reskilling should be used instead.
Those not covered could indeed end up working 86 hours per week, every week of the year.
Working people will be attacked on two fronts: by the national authorities and by 'private individuals who would be affected'.
Working women are often perceived to be 'high risk' or 'second rate' workers.
Labour was always the pioneer of the broken gun.
The inadequate anti-flooding works and the unsound soil as a result of the fires, in conjunction with the intensity of the rain, caused one death and massive damage to villages, roads, bridges and other infrastructure.
Construction work on the Bystroye Canal in Ukraine continues.
The work of the Planning Team is as yet unfinished, but the intention is for their report to be in the hands of the Council’s working group at the end of the month.
The agency' s work must be clearly associated with the European Union and not diluted in the broader activities of the numerous bodies that are dealing with Kosovo and the region. That is not for any reason of insularity; a clear division of tasks is essential in order to ensure proper accountability.
The new Commission’s work on this dossier has been first-rate, but little information and few explanations were provided when this 1 200-page report was first put before the House.
My group is regularly disrupted, not just by exhibitions right outside Room 100, but by the accompanying noisy receptions.
It must be done properly and properly financed; no cutting down on the amount of cooling time.
The work must be done and has to be paid for somehow.

Work on off-balance-sheet items is also under way in the IASB.
Work on the Rome I and Rome III Regulations is under way.
The other 38 were given prison sentences from 3 to 14 years.
Children in their earliest years are particularly curious, receptive and willing to learn, with this being the age at which the ability to speak and express themselves is formed.
Children in their earliest years are particularly curious, receptive and willing to learn, and important skills such as the ability to speak and express oneself, as well as social skills, are formed at this age.
Stress, lifestyle, chemicals and viruses can also cause cancer.
Stressful conditions in the workplace can have an impact on the state of mind of a woman who is pregnant or has recently given birth.
The courts were bought and sold.
There are techno and house-music tribes looking for new rituals led by strangely charismatic nocturnal animals known as DJs.
The schemers should be penalised.
The three major accidents in the Tauern, Mont Blanc and St Gotthard tunnels – to which the Commissioner has already referred – made the peculiar characteristics of accidents in tunnels tragically apparent.
The three remaining items, however, which have been dumped in the common bag of the amending budget, are of a different nature.
The next three questions are all on the DASS.
The three other reports closely reflect the problems and issues of the sector.

All three institutions are very close together in their proposals and understanding of what has to be done.
You are familiar with the three objectives: the famous three times twenty objectives.
The three sides are at least talking about acting against these cruel animal traps.
The three people concerned are: Mrs Jana Hybášková, Mrs Nina Škottová and Mr Rihards Piks.
The first three years of a child's life are crucial for the development of the brain and for language learning.
The first three of these have had their seven-league boots on for some time, while the last has been left to hobble forward unaided by the Commission.
The first three studies - on trigger factors, narrative and mobilisation tactics - are to be approved in the coming month.
The first three may well be self-explanatory.
The three main suspects wanted by the Metropolitan police - Andrei Lugovoi, Dmitry Kovtun and Vyacheslav Sokolenko - are still free in Russia.
The 3 multi-annual projects funded in 2007 include minority and world languages such as Catalan, Basque, Sardinian, Sicilian, Irish, Russian, Arabic and Hindi.

Three-quarters of all measures which fall into this programming period are not yet concluded.
There are three key issues; firstly, for example, the title of the act.
The three reports presented by the Commission in February were debated for the first time at the conference.
The three reports on e-Learning by Messrs Mauro, Perry and Alavanos are excellent.
The three reports took account of these shortcomings and also defined them excellently.
Around the Mediterranean the three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity, Islam - were founded and fostered and spread throughout the known world.
The three meetings showed discrepancies.
The three symbols (the flag showing 12 golden stars on a blue background, the anthem based on the 'Ode to Joy' from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and the motto 'United in Diversity') help to bring the citizens closer to the European Union and to build a European identity that complements our national identities.
The three Ts need more money.
Trolls are destroyed by daylight.
The Trotskyists grew older, if not up.
The riots in Kalimantan are no exception.
Depression and anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problems experienced in Europe.
Depression and anxiety disorders, including stress and eating disorders, are the most common mental health problems experienced.
Psychological disorders and suicide are very common, and the average life expectancy is around 52.
Mental ill-health is a major risk factor for suicide in Ireland and suicide itself is the biggest killer of our young people.
The disturbances surrounding the cartoons of Muhammad also appear perfectly to suit the regime in Tehran, and there are many indications that it is precisely Tehran that is fomenting the disturbances.
The disturbances taking place in Tunisia over recent days have already resulted in at least 35 confirmed deaths.
The mercenaries must be pulled out.
These troops were in Gori, just 45 or 50 km from Tbilisi.

The estuary is not the tundra, nor is the savannah the desert.
The carbon rods which control the cooling system have a remaining lifespan of possibly 8 years.
Tulips are vital to peace'.
Malignant tumours are the second most common cause of death in children.
Turks defended Europe's flank against Bolshevik expansionism for 50 years.
Turkey is supporting the linguistically and ethnically related Azeris in the war over Nagorno-Karabakh, and has closed its border crossings with Armenia.
The Tutsis of Nilotic origin are the minority tribe, but they dominate the government and the army.
The Tutsis, who are also recognisably different in appearance from the Hutus, were the rulers.
Lifestyle, as well as genetics, can apparently affect the likelihood of getting breast cancer.
As usual, the rhetoric is high-flown and hollow at one and the same time.
It does not matter how much style and gloss you put on a project, because if the substance is rotten then it will fail.
Soil and subsoil types are important considerations in characterising the vulnerability of aquifers to contamination.
The main types of cancer are lung, bowel and breast cancer.
The success of this programme is clearly expressed in the large number of projects that have been submitted.
The success of enlargement is also dependent on Europe becoming more parliamentary.
It has been a success beyond the wildest imagination of its founders.
The success of the vaccination campaigns against rabies have led to a fall in the number of cases amongst cats and dogs from nearly 500 in 1991 to just 5 in 1998 and it is because of that success that we have seem the partial abolition of the six-month quarantine system in the United Kingdom and Sweden.
The key to all successful presidencies is leadership.
The success of URBAN during the 1994-1999 programming period is indisputable.
The initial success of this policy was very obvious until 2007 or early 2008.
You would then be able to count a complete novelty amongst the successes of your Presidency.
Sugaring is an old oenological process.
Sucralose presents no problems: it is made from sugar, it is non-calorific, it does not lead to tooth decay or - and here let me declare an interest - to risks for those of us who live with diabetes.
Sugar is also one of the most crucial export products for many of those same poor countries.
Sugar is a significant component in the consumer’s average shopping basket.
Sugar has other uses besides sweets.
Sugar has other uses besides sweets.
Sugar may increasingly become a strategic commodity.
The south of Poland is famous for being thrifty and hard-working.
South Asia faces extremism every day, whether on the battlefield in Helmand or on the streets of Peshawar, Lahore and Rawalpindi.
The southern Caucasus could become a calvary but it could also remain a powder keg.
The south-west of Afghanistan is not particularly heavily mined.
South Yorkshire has had the highest level of targeting – ‘Objective One’.
The suffix '-stan' means 'state' and Tajikistan is the last of the countries whose names end in '-stan' to be recognised as a state by us.
The suicide of the leader of the Korean peasants symbolises in a tragic manner the despair of millions of men and women dishonoured by this fool's bargain.
Suicide is thus the only cause of death which has not declined in Europe.
Suicide is very relevant to the EU because five out of the top ten countries in terms of suicide rates are EU Member States: Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, Slovenia and Latvia.
Waste tallow is only included in the scope of the directive where it is incinerated or co-incinerated.
It is not only tallow that creates a problem, although it is the most pressing one.
The tallow that is being designated as a waste in these three Member States will not be considered a waste in the other Member States.
The monitoring of this measure would require much more time, and potentially also more staff, unpacking of items and other procedures.
Follow-up of the problem of refugees and displaced persons in the CIS is also high on the list of areas for action.
The state of monitoring is described as a major constraint.
Follow-up and evaluation must also be improved.
Satellite monitoring is cold comfort for the animals.
Mrs Grossetête, Mrs De Sarnez, Mr Martinez, Mr Mulder and Mr Belder in particular referred to Turkey.
The subject is 'equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity'.
The topic is an exciting one.
The subject is very popular with the media and is given great media coverage.
The topic is not unknown to me.
This subject is not closed.
The issue which you raise is a very serious one.
The subject will not go away.
The very fashionable issue of the clash of cultures or dialogue between cultures is symbolised by the Mediterranean.
Perhaps the Ukrainians, who have witnessed the devastation of part of their country for the last 25 years, are the only others qualified to speak about this.
The Ukrainians are much closer to Europe civilisation-wise than are the Turks or the Albanians.
Do the Ukrainians want to take risks?
Sulphites are typically used in processing dried fruits, for example for breakfast products.
Sulphites are among the contributing factors here.
Mercury sulphide is almost completely insoluble, which means that it can be stored safely.
Microlights have small engines, air stall speeds as low as 35 knots and limited weight.
Low tar cigarettes cause just as much damage as normal cigarettes.
Both of these are necessary if confidence is to be restored.
Units 1-4 are of the more dangerous VVER 440-230 type, and should be closed forthwith.
Items of rolling stock authorised to be placed into service in a given Member State must be covered by this authorisation in other Member States, if indeed the latter require such authorisation.
Units vary in size and, for example, a low population density or gradual depopulation are overlooked.
The Lithuanian lecturers were quite astonished.
Universities have shared information with each other for centuries, before the EU existed.
There are those who say that women are meant to go out to work in order to fulfil themselves, whilst others believe that they have been allotted the traditional role of wife and mother.
Many of us and many others too need to reflect on the road we have travelled, on the reasons for the backward movement and on the apparent incompatibility and autism of those currently in power.
Some saw this as the 'Employment Summit' , others as the 'Summit for the Society of Innovation and Knowledge' .
Some are due to the crisis per se, which started last spring.
The artificial super-state which we want to build has all the characteristics of a power which is both technocratic and distant.
The superlevy must be lowered when the quota is being used but when sales are done with virtually no support to the European Union.
Its support for organisations that destabilise the region cannot be tolerated.
There is no need at all for supranationalism in this area.
The additional cost announced will be higher than expected.
Overgrazing and deforestation are factors, but so is the rise in the world's temperature.
Excessive weight entails a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and certain forms of cancer.
The backlash you are creating by denying the people a referendum will bring this intolerant EU empire down as sure as day follows night.
The United States did not tie itself in the same knots as the European Commission when it came to instituting the procedure to safeguard itself against Chinese textile products.
The USA remains at the lower end with USD 20.
The Bürkert works in Ingelfingen were saved by this.
The factories that grew up in their place are outsourcing work overseas.
Factory is pitted against factory and worker against worker.
The suspense is excruciating.
A certain degree of drama, but not too much, is always a bonus.
Consumers will continue to be able to buy products with which to combat a specific organism, as an active substance is only replaced if a new substance can be used for the same purpose.
Internet users inform one another quickly of political developments as they happen.
Users of the Internet will have full control and be able to filter out this kind of material automatically, and so there should be complete transparency.
Users and merchants will be clamouring for more choice.
Users are not sure what they can and cannot do with the digital content they have purchased.
Users will have access to information that was previously kept internally.
Professional users will only be granted authorisation after they have completed a training course. The training course must, among other things, provide information about the risks of dichloromethane and the availability of alternative substances.
Users are bound by any number of digital contracts that they have simply clicked on and have not read.
The daydreams of romantic amateurs will not change this fact.
Creators' works must overcome a number of obstacles, such as problems in connection with distribution and promotion and extensive piracy, in order to find a way of reaching the European public.
They go to the coast on the other side.
Vaccines are an essential means of decisively combating tuberculosis, together with better testing for detection of infection that is reliable and low cost, as well as more effective diagnosis and treatment.
Vaccines for polio, German measles, hepatitis B, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella and meningitis, along with combined therapy drugs for HIV, medicines to control asthma, life support systems for premature babies and deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, have all been developed through experimentation on animals, and specifically primates.
Today's vaccines are more advanced.
The vaccines used hitherto, which were those to which the aforementioned directive applied, led to the risk of transmission of the virus to unvaccinated animals, which is the reason why vaccination was only allowed in specially designated zones.
Mother cows are kept at pasture, and the calves drink milk for several months but are also already eating grass, which contains iron, making their meat pink or red.
The price of cull cows and calves has fallen just as sharply as that of beef cattle.
Cows must regularly be led to pasture again and geese must from now on be spared torture for the sake of their tastefully prepared livers.
Cows simply need to be milked.
Cows, sheep and pigs are more than production units.
Cows should never have been fed the remains of other cows, but it was not just a problem in the UK.
The waves, of course, continued to lap at their feet and the King had proved his point.
The victors mainly belong to one major tribe, the Kikuyu.
Victory was theirs; it was the Brussels bureaucrats who lost.
The winners will be the food industrialists, who will import cheap sugar; the losers will be sugar industry workers, since more mills will close and further numbers of small and medium-sized sugar beet producers will be wiped out.
These have seen a raising, and thus a limiting, of the existing values to 40 and 70 ìg/l respectively. This is despite the fact that the Commission's own scientific advisory committee has said that trichlorethene is probably carcinogenic, which now also appears to be the view of the WHO's cancer research centre.
The values for Spanish operators are as little as one two-hundredth of the safe limit values.
This means it is important that the levels should be binding, and not merely indicative.
The values were a maximum of four times too high.
The values and laws of the EU cannot be treated like an à la carte menu - we will take this dish, but not that one.

The birth rate in EU countries remains low.
The average birth rate in the EU is 1.5 children, one of the lowest in the world; this can only be reversed with robust policies in support of families, which do not penalise men and women who decide to have children, in economic, tax and professional terms.
The average birth rate in women in the European Union is 1.5, which is too low to replace the current generations.
The birth rate, on the other hand, goes down when the social position of women improves, when they receive an education and information on birth control, and when they have their own means of earning a livelihood.

Loading time is of a supplementary nature and cannot be regarded as a significant part of working time, as the law does not apply, for instance, to journeys under 100 km.
All drivers are limited to driving times and associated work monitored by the tachograph.
Driving time represents only half - on average - of the working time of a driver.
The driving time we have stipulated – 90 hours in two weeks, but no more than 56 hours in a week – is still a considerable one.
On-call duty for firefighters, for example, need no longer be remunerated.
On-call time for medical staff will continue to be counted as working time.
The time for a decision has come; we have to choose: more Europe, or the opt-out.
Although we have yet to say a final goodbye to the traditional heroin, cocaine or marijuana, we are facing a new reality that is about to erupt like a volcano.

Meeting times will be limited and clear and concise conclusions will be adopted.
Working time for long-distance drivers must take account of the amount of time which is actually worked (unloading, loading, breaks, etcetera)., it must very quickly come down to the 35-hour week and should never exceed 39 hours.
Working hours should be both shorter and, of course, more flexible.
Not only driving times, which are monitored using the tachograph, but also loading and unloading times should now be considered as working time for everyone.
Working time is clearly part and parcel of this process and needs to be monitored.
Working time will still be calculated over a 4 month period, with exemptions available to calculate over 12-months – subject to stronger control through collective bargaining.
Nothing is more of a factor in stress and poor performance than excessively long hours of work.

When I see how long it all takes, that is when I start losing patience.
This is not, therefore, the time.
Now is not the time for passivity, but for activity and determination.
The time for asking questions has passed.
Time will tell if they are suitable or if they have to be improved.
Time will tell whether the revolution is the same, or whether a number of leaders have brought another process in motion.
Time, however, is clearly running out.
Time is running out.
Chancellor Schröder' s days of talking it up and laughing it off are finally at an end!
Time is pressing, Commissioner; it is time for action.
And time is short, because the spawning season starts in the middle of this month.
Time is short!

The word 'constitution' appears 32 times in the first 16 articles.
The term 'contaminated' must be defined in purely scientific terms with reference to substances and/or bacteria that have been added from outside, whereas 'contain undesirable substances' also includes those substances that are formed naturally, e.g. in the course of storage, when fat oxidises and mycotoxins are formed. There are lots of substances that are clearly inappropriate in feed, but which do not come from outside.

"Expertise" is the appropriate word.
'Inadequate' is not a satisfactory term.
The word 'smart' could not be more misleading or more inappropriate.
The term 'fruit juice' would be reserved for juices without concentrate, while, according to them, juices made from concentrate should be named for sale purposes in accordance with their characteristics.

The term ‘more Europe’ must mean above all an enhanced Europe in Europe itself.
The term 'President' applies to the individual who is in the Chair at that time, so it is 'President' or 'Vice-President'.

Terrorism always has fathers, leaders, an organization, networks, financial backers. There is never any justification!
Mass terrorism is the final stage of that process.
Terrorism in Europe is not a foreign secretion.
Terrorism is often only addressed from the other side.
Terrorism is a fulminant infection in the body of our society. Like any infection, if left untreated, it will keep spreading until it incapacitates, or even kills, the patient.
Terrorism has not been defeated.
They lie in hopelessness and despair, in poverty, in the preaching of hatred.
Terrorism is based on both a psychological and a social and media effect.
The terrorist belongs to the Armata Corsa organisation.
The terrorist feeds on this type of propaganda; this is what he needs to survive, it is grist to his mill.
The test should be very simple.
The test seems to be completely conclusive.
The TB test we use now is herd-specific, not animal-specific.
The test has not been passed.
The test can be applied in different ways, and no, it is not always perfect.

The text should be amended to read: ‘Stressing the further need to enhance cooperation between EU Member States and in particular to reduce eutrophication’.
The wording of the regulation has been simplified and its application made easier.
The text is as follows: '5a. Calls for the liberation of Dr Ayman Nour'.
The text therefore reads: 'instruments with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation' .
It is Ovid, and it translates as 'Stop it at the start; it is late for medicine to be prepared when disease has grown strong through long delays'.
It is also clear from the text that war can upset the best-laid plans.
Literally the Hebrew means as follows: 'And Cain said to Abel, and it came to pass when they were out in the field that Cain rose up against Abel and killed him.'
There is only one version available in one language, and, in addition to this, in this language there are different versions of the same text with various discrepancies between them.

The published text reads "...and the estimated rate of growth is not attained' .
The text adopted by the Conciliation Committee still contains a number of sensitive points, such as the needle exchange projects and the use of methadone substitution therapy.
The text now puts back the review date to 2007, which gives much more opportunity for practical experience with after-treatment technology to be achieved before stages IIIB and IV are confirmed.

The text would therefore read as follows: 'state aid rules to measures taken and their conformity with the Treaty provisions'.

Moving on to labelling, in a free market it is not up to the legislator to decide what ingredients the manufacturer is to use.
Labelling will also help to improve public health in general and the environment.
Marking of food is the alpha and omega.
Egg labelling will be mandatory.
The product label should also provide consumers with clear and easily understandable information about the correct way to administer the product.
The labelling of tobacco products other than cigarettes must be subject to the same conditions.
Energy efficiency labelling must be standardised in such a way that all consumers of any age, including children and the elderly, understand how much energy a piece of equipment consumes.
Product labelling is one important way in which this misinformation can be countered.
Labelling products, however, will not provide the consumer with anything more than an indication that genetic technology was used in the production of the goods and the changes that its use has produced.
Labelling must therefore be perfect and not have the opposite of the intended effect.
Labels must be clear, and allergies must be taken into consideration, especially with products intended for children.
Labelling should tell consumers how to use vitamin and mineral products correctly.
Labelling must allow for accurate health messages, such as for folic acid.

Eco-labelling on fisheries products states that they were produced in accordance with a specific series of environmental rules and that their method of production does not have adverse repercussions on the environment.
Labelling is still an illusion.
Clearly, labelling and rules must be the same for imported products too.
The undifferentiated labelling of trans fats will only confuse consumers, create a negative image of healthy dairy products and have undesirable effects on consumption, undermining public health (reduced intake of important nutrients such as calcium and proteins, for example).
Labelling has nothing to do with warning signs.
Labelling, therefore, only solves a small part of the problem.
Labelling is only an initial step.
Labelling or marking should not be misleading and should be provided in such a way that the consumer can easily understand to which part of the product the particulars refer.
Therefore, labelling enables those whose judgement differs from mine to avoid products they chose to reject.
It is therefore perfectly possible to label properly, as the substance is always detectable.
Labelling will also be applied to commercial and industrial energy-using products, such as cold storage rooms or chilled display cabinets.
Traffic-light labelling is not representative as it only shows certain aspects in isolation, so it confuses consumers.
The label should contain information on the animal' s region of origin, where it is born, fattened up and slaughtered.
The label must cover 30% of the packet surface, 35% if the wording is bilingual, and 12.5% of the outer surface of the wrapping for pipe tobacco.

The label on the product must be sufficiently large.
The label only comes along when the fork is poised; but the best solution would be to label when the pitchfork is poised.

Their effects are already apparent in the mother-child prevention programmes set up by UNAIDS and UNICEF.
Their Eminences of the Council want to be the only ones to dole out largesse and to make promises; none of the glory must rub off on anyone else, certainly not on Parliament.

The assessment that the Commission has commissioned shows no trace of effective implementation.
The evaluation commissioned by the Authority cannot address the whole regulation, as it can only be relevant to the Authority.
These proposals are currently being evaluated.
The evaluation of the Year will get under way this month.
The evaluation of these resources cannot be automatic, but must take into account the behaviour of the individual.
The measurement of that will be done year by year in the regular reports on the basis of the progress made by each and every individual candidate country.
The assessment of the MIF of a developed system like MasterCard and the assessment of a MIF which new entrants in the market may wish to apply in order to start competing are not necessarily the same.
Quality evaluation is one of those.
This assessment of the overall impact of the different research activities will be carried out by high-level experts.

This must be reflected in the safety risk assessment.
Identifying needs is only one part of the problem.
The needs will be assessed by the FAO.

In the assessment of information on the medication recommended in the event of a health emergency, especially in pandemic situations;
Benchmarking and gender-specific statistics should give us information which needs to be evaluated every year.
A risk assessment of these factors has revealed that the circumstances which can cause such a high incidence of the disease, and also a high prevalence of scrapie - a change in the method of processing carcasses and a high proportion of meat and bone meal in feed - exist to this extent only in the UK.
Risk evaluation of long-term effects has been enshrined, as has the possibility for Member States to set additional requirements for environmentally sensitive areas.
There would have to be a thorough evaluation of the risks involved, and that would have to extend to an assessment of possible delayed effects.
Risk assessment has to be undertaken by those who are qualified and expert in that area - that is the scientists.
Risk assessments have shown, as Mrs Ries has just said, that the use of pentabromodiphenyl ether carries risks for the environment and public health, because this bromide-based, flame retardant agent is used in the production of furniture and upholstery.
The risk assessment carried out examined in particular the toxic and allergenic potential of the introduced genes and it was concluded that there was no reasons to believe there would be any adverse effects on human health in the environment from the introduction into soya beans of the genes coding for glysophate tolerance and the chloroplast transit peptide.
The review of all of the material which is to take place in order to finally clarify the position of the European Research Council should be fixed to take place in 2008.
The evaluation carried out is relevant from several points of view.
The assessment is along the lines of ‘could do better’.
Last year's assessment noted that there has been 'no overall improvement in river quality'.
The review merely expresses concern that progress is not being made as quickly as envisaged in the timetables.
The appraisal carried out on both of these kinds of issues cannot be reduced to specific for or against positions being taken in Parliament regarding the French decision.
The assessment will be conducted by the Commission within the framework of the progress report to be presented to the Council in the autumn.
As the Gospel puts it, 'Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven'.

The most disturbing event, and the subject of our resolution, was the Maguindanao massacre, the assassination of 46 people who had been following the electoral convoy of the opposition candidate Mr Mangudadatu.
An event in its entirety is visible only when it has fully taken shape and become what is recognizable as the past.
Hugo Chávez's Venezuela has something of the feel of Eastern Europe in the late 1940s.
There must be diversity in the range of rural occupations, and the countryside has to be developed with respect for nature and recreation.
The range of occupational hazards is extremely broad, and the risk of harmful health effects and of developing chronic diseases is considerable.
It now covers communication technology, information technology and biotechology.
The wind triumphed over electricity pylons, roofs, traffic signs and, ultimately over the forest.
The icy polar wind was blowing and many small one-man boats were lying in the harbour in thick ice.
The wind blowing from the other side of the Atlantic does not augur well and the growth forecasts for 2008 are lower than we might have hoped.
The possibility that investments may be delayed in certain regions means there may be a polarization between those who have information and those who do not.
The possible impact on tourism should also be set against the overall trend of a very strong growth in tourism demand.
The possible destruction of the crops, of animals or of buildings, has no consequence on the decoupled payment since there is no obligation to produce.
Bishop Julius Jia Zhiguo, who belongs to the underground church, was recently arrested.
Lift those stringent measures?
The verdict, not surprisingly, was a loud and clear ‘no’.
A decision by the court is expected over the next week.
The verdict is identical.
The real alcoholism and health problems which result can only be combated by information and education.
The real dilemma is this: will it be the people or the plutocracy that defaults?
The crux of the matter is that this fixation with travel expenses is out of all proportion!
The real purpose is centralised control.
The real problem does not arise from the ionisation process itself as much as from the use to which it is put.

The power as well as the security vacuum must be filled.
Evidence seems to contradict any research the Commission used to increase the minimum landing size of these molluscs as, from 30-32 millimetres upwards, the carpetshell is mature and can reproduce.
The fact that the alliance has been sucked into a political vacuum enabled the rebellion to undertake a breathtaking military campaign, but it left the alliance with a number of poorly trained and ill-disciplined new recruits and a few very loosely controlled contingents with specific ethnic characteristics, be it Banyamulenge or an independent historic origin, as the descendants of the so-called gendarmes Katangais .
The old adage about putting all your eggs in one basket rings true.
I think the old adage of testing the ground by walking on it would be particularly wise in this case, Mr Solana.
Ageing, as with many human phenomena, affects men and women in different ways: it is by no means a gender-neutral phenomenon.
The ageing of some boats, the lack of on-board safety and proper safety training make accidents even more likely.
The working population will age almost everywhere, but not at the same time, and not gradually.
Population-ageing, increases in the incidence of disease and increases in the treatments for them mean a greater demand for workers in the health sector.
The ageing of the population means that the economic basis is vulnerable.
Ageing is not a territorial problem.
The premature ageing and health deficiencies seen in high-profile cloning cases that have made the headlines, such as that of Dolly the sheep, are good reminders of those welfare issues.
The progressive ageing of the European population is being accompanied by a substantial increase in the number of people suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, 50% of which turn out to be Alzheimer's disease.
Vietnam is heavily dependent on a single product group, namely shoes.
Vietnam has not been liberated from the communist strait-jacket, no more than has Laos, or Cambodia.
In Vietnam, there is a market-Leninist state with a strong reformist movement leading to gradual improvements.
The old saying 'give a man a fish, you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, you feed him for life' is a very wise one.
HIV/AIDS involves medicines which are priced way above the potential of the poorest and most vulnerable.
HIV, tuberculosis and malaria are the world's greatest killers and are the most serious diseases affecting the world today.
HIV/Aids has had a devastating effect on the country, with one in five adults being HIV positive and over one million children orphaned through the loss of their parents from Aids.
HIV/AIDS also causes malnutrition and starvation, for a rural population which is sick cannot cultivate its fields, or can only do so to a limited extent.
HIV/AIDS is closely linked with malaria and tuberculosis, which are also poverty-related infectious diseases.
Aids-HIV is a terrible illness with which approximately 7 000 people are infected worldwide every 24 hours - without knowing it.
HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are poverty-related diseases which are rampant in the developing countries.
HIV/AIDS: is it a forgotten problem or is it a hidden disease?
Wine goes hand-in-hand with cuisine; it is the mark of the region where it was produced, it carries the flavour of the cultivated soil and it is the symbol of festivity and of living together.
Wine does have a beneficial effect on health, and should be considered as a food.
In Europe, wine is not water plus chemicals plus flavourings, as it is in the self-styled wineries of California or Australia, but a food produced from fermented grapes.
Blended wine is not rosé; it is a mixed white.
Buckfast wine should, apparently, be banned because it contains both alcohol and caffeine.

Wine is an agricultural product, made once a year.
Wine is a fermented product, not a mixed product.
Wine is a natural product which, taken regularly and in moderation, is beneficial to health.
The twentieth century was turbulent and exciting: it spanned three epochs, from peasant society to the industrial and post-industrial era, and went even further in its final decade.
Wine does not contain fat or sugar but alcohol, which is already graded in current labelling.
So this particular wine has been tasted at some length.

Has the virus attacked man?
The avian flu virus is seldom transmitted from birds to humans; however, the WHO has reported 185 cases of this infection and 104 deaths in the period from 2003 to March 2006.
The influenza virus is an RNA virus containing eight genes.
Not only is the virus highly communicable, but the delay yet again in providing the relevant information has helped it to spread.
The virus does not survive at a temperature of more than 26º C, and is therefore not dangerous to humans.
The virus can travel with returning players and fans in food and on their footwear.
The virus, which is transmitted by mosquitos, has now already infected 200 000 of the 760 000 inhabitants of the island of Réunion and is thought to be directly responsible for the deaths of five people.
It appears to be resistant to treatment by antibiotics, to have a variable development and not necessarily to follow the course one would expect in terms of the vulnerability of the patients concerned.
The virus is spread 90% through sexual contact and 10% through drug use.
The virus harms cold-blooded animals.

Differential diagnostics continue to change, which is why specialist training must also include general practice.
The development, both of production and fishing activity, together with marketing, changes in consumption etcetera, would justify certain adjustments.

The consistent and continual examination of issued ratings by the supervisory authorities has also been forgotten about.
This report will be considered from four perspectives: firstly, 'mainstreaming' and the right to be different, secondly, 'family and disability' , because it is true that a disabled person, whether an infant or an old person, is nonetheless someone' s child or parent and it is within this family environment that the most support can be found.

Donor testing is important in minimising the risks to the recipient.
The examination of an application for asylum cannot be legally delayed.
Consideration of the report will take five minutes and it is absolutely essential for a decision to be taken in order to avoid wastage in the EDICOM system.

The exclusion of donors on the basis of these criteria could be definitive or temporary, depending on the case and the illness.
Expulsion from university means that a person's education comes to an abrupt end.

The example of France has made it impressively clear how the number of road accidents can be reduced by 10 % in the space of one year.
The example of the Great Barrier Reef demonstrates that marine ecosystems can regenerate if the necessary environmental protection measures are put in place. In the protected areas of the reef, the fish population has increased by between 30% and 75% in only two years.
This is clearly evident from the example of Poland.
Some of us still recall the time when hydroelectric dams burst.
The example of Mor Gabriel forms part of this issue.

The example of Portugal is particularly revealing.
This is demonstrated by the sum remaining of the EDF.

The Irish example has shown that this check was fundamentally unreliable.
The Kurdish example shows once more that the debate has become a little overheated.

Our experience is too limited and too uncertain in the area of GMOs.
The experience of certain States who use this system is not encouraging.
The experience of implementing the European Union Emission Trading Scheme has completely discredited the value of regulation through the market and clearly demonstrated the ineffectiveness and perversity of its instruments.

Pakistan's experience of democracy in the past 60 years has been troubled.
I know from my own country, Sweden, where breast-screening has been available for many years to women in certain age groups, that such screening has reduced the death rate amongst women and that it is important to detect the disease early in order to provide the right treatment.
The experience from my own country shows me that national bureaucracies are unbelievably obstructive, and stubbornly resist all changes that would limit their ability to victimise small businesses.
Experience has shown that total grubbing-up operations, such as those carried out in 1990-1993 and 1994-1995, are of limited effectiveness and more difficult to monitor, since they require complete information about and total control over the fruit orchards of applicants.

The UK experience shows that it is possible to have a competitive industry, but that the adjustment process can be tough and painful.
So did the Rwandan experience.
Experience in Europe has shown that this watering down simply results in a shift to precarious working conditions and does not create new jobs.

The extension of the withdrawal period from 10 to 14 days has been mentioned.
Port expansion at Bathside Bay, so recently approved at Harwich, and the positive decision we very much hope for this week for the Felixstowe South expansion, are both in jeopardy.
And the extension of the first enlargement to include five countries is measured by the same standard.
Extended full-price intervention
The switch-off of analogue radio broadcasting will free up spectrum in the UHF band, which is particularly appealing due to the propagation properties of UHF radio waves.
Bacteria-based extraction would be more nature-friendly, but it is not yet used for gold.
Excessive water extraction, conducting untreated waste water to Jordan, and the uncontrolled dumping of community waste have led to unthinkable health risks and a shortage of water.
The oil activity in the Sudan should be looked upon as a resource for the country to be utilised to the fullest extent possible for the good of the Sudanese people.
In any case, the extreme time pressure which the participants were under did not serve any immediate purpose.
Extremism does not unite people and social groups: it divides them.
Extremism is still a current threat and these extremists have an unwitting friend in the ballot box - lethargy.
The 20th century has been characterised by a fundamental crisis of humanism as a result of xenophobia and acts of genocide.
The 20th century, alas, was marked by the attempted wholesale extermination of certain peoples.

So an end to hypocrisy on the part of society, the state and individuals.
Hypocrisy is the most odious charge we can be accused of.
With hypocrisy being the homage vice pays to virtue, I consider the procedural trick used by my political opponents to be the proof of the awkward position they are in – ‘awkward’ being a weak term – in relation to the content of this matter.

- The feeling is that the amendment with the addition covers the whole of the text.

It is generally accepted that the sharing of animal test data should be mandatory.

The island of Réunion is also on the extreme periphery of the Union and there would be no reason to exclude it.
The Island of Timor has been split into two parts and there are now two separate states, thanks to a referendum which was carried out democratically, although not in the best of conditions.

The theatre island in Guben, on the River Neisse, had not been used for 50 years until a concrete bridge enabled the inhabitants of Guben and Gubin to hold a Festival of Europe there together.
Widespread illiteracy - especially in certain countries, as the percentages she presents indicate - early school leaving, without achieving a level of study which prepares them for later life, and a lack of participation in the labour market - especially amongst young women - are factors which, together with poverty and marginalisation, above all affect women in the majority of cases.
The illogicality and irresponsibility of this report do not end there.
The image, often presented in advertisements, of how young women should look - all slim waists and large breasts - means that there is a considerable increase in the number of breast implants carried out on very young women.
I have always preferred the image of a European family to that of a European house, because the idea of building a house always suggests a building site, draughty, full of rubble and not very comfortable.
It has been possible to give Europe a slightly better image.
The image of the Union would be reinforced and enhanced.
But the picture painted by the European Commission is none too bright.
If asked to think of someone aged 60 or 65, one does not conjure up a picture of a decrepit individual whose physical and mental capacities are significantly impaired.
The image is apt.

Harm reduction alone is not a solution.

It has made an incredible impact in Northern Ireland and one of the reasons it has made an impact is because projects have to be either cross-community or cross-border.
The relative effects of these cuts, particularly on the viability of agricultural production, will be greater in the Union's remote areas than in the better production areas.

The impact and the number of measures applied by the European Union to imports of these products have gradually diminished in recent years.
The negative impact of this distorted market situation is very serious.
The negative effect of the last CAP reform is well known, particularly the untying of aid from production.
The negative impact of ship dismantling is particularly glaring.
Another sensitive subject is the impact on charities.
The impact assessment will be conducted in March.
The socio-economic impact is therefore enormous, not just in terms of the cost of treating and supporting patients but also in terms of the emotional strain involved.
The impact on the people locally will be disastrous.
This will immediately impact on the quality of service.
The impact on the lives of those caught in the crossfire, both literally and metaphorically, has been devastating.

The impertinence with which it has been returned on the table with the straight face of a poker player and now under a new Orwellian title is astounding.

The significance of Kashgar as a centre of culture for the Uyghur minority in China cannot be overstated.
The importance of ongoing cooperation on counter-terrorism and crisis/disaster management should also be stressed.
First of all, the importance of prevention and early diagnosis.
The importance of prevention cannot be emphasised enough, and this includes information.
The issue's importance must also be made apparent on all other days when we are taking decisions.

The importance of the present fire is due to the extreme drought, which has encouraged it to spread extremely rapidly.
This was justified given the extent of the damage done and the need to continue programmed investment.
The interests of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria patients worldwide must be at centre stage. Not commerce.

Therefore, the importance and influence of this industry is obvious - as are its dangers.
The geostrategic importance of the seas has increased greatly.
The historical significance of Budapest 1956 is much more than local or national.
The importance that Southern Sudanese citizens attached to this referendum was also plain to see, with a turn-out of 60% being achieved by the fourth day.
What is important are the options, not quantity.
The most important thing is that the products on the market should be those with the least environmental impact and that lower quality products should be removed from the market or that the 'reassessment procedure' should be used.
The baby was important.
The sizeable younger generation wants an end to the exclusion of politicians whose views differ from those of the conservative clergy, to restrictive rules for women, to the expulsion of students, and to the frequent hanging, stoning or amputation of body parts of those who do not fit into the world view of the authorities.
The major international meeting this April will decide to launch an evaluation of these conventions.
What matters is that you have one common and good quality plan to fight the pandemic.

Is being imprudent, however, a crime?
Our powerlessness is combined with anger.
In particular, the helplessness of the European Union in the face of all the developments in the area of the southern Mediterranean gives cause for concern.
Inaction as regards the prevention of counterfeiting promotes impunity and appears cynical.
The inactivity of the past days is particularly painful, given that the European Commission made a good job of defining the steps which may reduce Europe's dependence.
The inadequate care that the state provides for children of pre-school age is one of the reasons why women are less likely to secure roles at decision-making levels.
The EU's delay in responding at an appropriate level was deeply shocking and is unacceptable; senior EU leaders were not visible.
Imprisonment of women can have particularly grave implications when they have been the sole carers of their children prior to imprisonment.
Uncertainty about Russian participation in Kyoto must not lead to paralysis.
There is uncertainty over possible allergic reactions and over health generally.
Uncertainty is the opposite of trust.
Uncertainty scares off investment whereas trust attracts it.
Legal uncertainty was brought up, as was a reduction in competition as a result of problems experienced by small car dealers.
This scientific uncertainty is likely to run and run.
A greater incidence of poaching putting those engaged in the protection of wildlife and the natural protection authorities under increasing pressure, and effective protection of pachyderms, which are important in terms of many countries' incomes from tourism, makes increasing demands on resources that are generally scarce; the only long-term protection for ivory is an absolute ban on the trade in it, for it is estimated that some 20 000 elephants a year are killed in Africa for their tusks.
The incidence of tuberculosis and, in particular, the varying levels in the treatment and monitoring of the disease, are connected with the varying socio-economic conditions in different regions and also in different social groups.
The BSE incidence in Spain has been increasing since the beginning of 2002.
The incidence of BSE in the Community gives mixed signals.
The impact of new technology and the advent of new market participants has led to faster trading speeds and to an increase in direct market access by clients of trading platform members.
The incidence of cancer in children is increasing by 1% per annum, and it has become the second most common cause of death in childhood.
The incidence of cancer in the infant population is 50 times higher than 10 years ago.
The incidence of breast cancer in the Netherlands is higher than anywhere else.
The impact of a duty on the price of such shoes is therefore potentially greater than it is for ordinary shoes.
The unusually high incidence of BSE in the United Kingdom, compared with the other Member States, can be attributed to various factors.
This will have even less of an impact on all 27 European Union Member States.
The whole incident was filmed.
The incident was resolved after an hour and the power supply was re-established.
The Detroit incident has shown that there is present danger, that the threat persists and, therefore, the Member States must not allow that continuing flow of financial data to the TFTP to be abandoned.
The incident that took place on 5 July involved a premeditated attack on the Han Chinese population of that city by the Uighurs.
High-temperature incineration remains the exception.
Waste incineration by itself cannot be a renewable energy.
Incineration of PVC makes the problem even worse, as apart from the risk of dioxin formation the hazardous residues resulting from PVC incineration may even exceed the quantities of PVC put into incineration.
Burning is often the cheapest method to recover these valuable metals as adults and children scramble over the dumps of rubbish in their quest to earn a few cents.
Incineration is often the most effective and safe method of waste disposal.
This incineration generates polluting emissions of dust, metals and dioxins which must be controlled using a smoke treatment system.
Incineration which is not controlled properly is just as dangerous - and even more so - for our health and for the environment as the random dumping of waste.
Incineration is not inevitable.
Incineration can be the cause of illnesses, air pollution, climatic change and a rise in the sea level.
And it is being too kind in watering down the expression by adding the phrase 'at times'.
The incitement given by former General Makashov to hate Jews responds to a system that is well tested.
Inciting hatred and violence with impunity should not be allowed.
Incitement to violence is banned in all Member States, and that is the way it should be - but now provocation, too, is being criminalised.
Incitement to violence or hatred will also have to be made punishable throughout the EU if committed by public dissemination or distribution of pictures.
Incitement to violence or hatred would also be punishable if committed by public dissemination and distribution of tracts, pictures and other materials.
Another answer might be to promote the use of reactive solvents, in which a chemical reaction causes the coating to become a part of the binding agent, so that it is not inhaled.
The inclusion of a specific human-rights-related suspension clause in the PCA would require amending the PCA.
The inclusion of the human rights clause in all negotiations is a major victory, but the results must be evaluated at regular intervals so that policies and initiatives can be adjusted.
To include Britain in these restrictive measures is to couple insult with injury.
The inclusion of the environment as one of the criteria for the approval of additives is an improvement. The fact that the presence of azo dyes must be shown on labels is an improvement.
The fact that in Madeira Porto Santo or Porto Funchal can be included, in the Azores Punta Delgada, in the Canaries Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Cristianos, Santa Cruz de la Palma, San Sebastián de la Gomera, Las Palmas or Arrecife, in Réunion Pointe des Galets, in Guadeloupe Pointe-à-Pitre, or in Martinique Fort de France and Basse-Terre, clearly shows how important it is for these archipelagos that their ports can be incorporated once and for all as essential elements within the trans-European networks, bringing these outermost regions closer to the rest of the European Union.
The inclusion of undesirable ingredients by feed manufacturers in animal feed was responsible for BSE and the Dioxin scare.
The inclusion of the driver's licence in the controls is a useful addition.
The inclusion of paragraph 4, ' Provisions concerning the branding of components' , in paragraph 3 implies that the provisions concerning branding will only apply to mopeds and light motorcycles.
The inclusion of inactive on-call time in the daily rest period of 11 hours and the weekly rest period of 24 hours will not be permitted.
Inclusion is on the agenda in a great variety of contexts.
The inconsistency is astonishing.
The incompetence and weakness demonstrated by EADS' two main private shareholders are proof of this.
The incorporation of the nine new Member States was possible only under exceptional conditions, of course.
The negligence of certain Member States has encouraged, if not aggravated, the impact of these disasters.
Indecisiveness reigned supreme.

Both India and Pakistan have indicated that the Line of Control could become a 'soft border'.
Hardly any of the victims have received compensation.

There is also a farmer's wife's weekly allowance, based on the wife's own insurance, which is payable for the statutory maternity leave period, which in Austria is four weeks before and four weeks after the birth of a child.
Members' assistance allowance was increased once again by EUR 1 500 per month only last week.
The daily allowance is not remuneration for participation in the sessions.
Independence was announced in the hotel where, years ago, guests were welcomed by the following sign above the door: 'Entry prohibited to dogs and Albanians'.
The independence of the European Union in assessing the severity of AH1N1 influenza and the resulting risk is crucial.
The independence of teachers is violated by the interference of supranational bodies in the way the universities work and are organised.
Economic independence is a key component of the empowerment of women and entrepreneurship should be encouraged, for example, through the use of micro-credits.
Independence is not incompatible with dialogue.
Self-employed workers seem to be subject to the same risks as dependent workers, but their deficient training and information may also be the cause of accidents and injuries for them and for other employed workers.
This indeterminate nature of fertilization is the strongest original defence of human liberty.
India will expand its biotechnology sector fivefold in the next five years.
The indicator in the worst state is 40% less than the average, and the difference between the best and the worst states in the uptake of funds is 370%, i.e. a factor of 3.7.
Nor does the language indicator provide any kind of incentive for an early change in this policy, and ‘later’ may well mean ‘too late’.
The European Indicator of Language Competence is very appropriate, because assessment, examinations and diplomas are a source of motivation.
Using the term low-risk gives the impression that a guarantee of the product's safety is being provided, but danger to the environment is of course precisely what is already being taken into account in the method for authorizing products which the Commission set out in its original proposal.
Information on the fattening process and, where applicable, on antibiotics or other stimulants administered, as demanded in proposed Amendment No 48, have absolutely no business to be on the label.
The indication of the origin of a product on a label, along with the diversification of the colour of Community logos and the authorisation of the use of expressions for processed products, are all innovations that address the need for greater protection of consumers.
The mandatory information on the label also applies in the case of preparations containing at least one substance classified as sensitising, present in concentrations equal to or in excess of 0.1 % That limit, lower than in the past, means that the preparation will have to be labelled, bearing a warning for individuals who may be sensitive to it.
We have also looked to provide positive indications.
The fertility index in European countries varies between 1.1 and 1.3.
The FAO Food Price Index of 55 basic foodstuffs has increased for the sixth consecutive month to 214.7 points, higher than the previous historic high of 213.5 points in June 2008.
The so-called optimism index has decreased over the last nine months by nine points, from 26 to 17.
The price index for the 25 main commodities has exploded by more than 200%.
The clue is in the phrase, and the answer is 'socialism'.
The indignation is growing by the hour.
This laxness is paid for in human life and the tears of those left behind.
Piggyback is the obvious answer to the unavoidable need to cross the Alps. It is clearly an expensive answer, but it is justified by its human and environmental benefits.
It will foster the individualization of society and is thus ultimately an asocial phenomenon.
The individual must learn for him or herself.
Indonesia is in the throes of becoming a democratic system.
Indonesia is a product of more than three centuries of Dutch colonialism.

The automotive industry is today facing a serious crisis: the European market has fallen by around 15%. This decline could reach 17% to 20% for the final quarters of 2008.
The car industry has applied the brakes, and the Commission is sitting back and watching.
The car industry only has a future if it opts in favour of energy-efficient and non-polluting cars.
The European chemicals industry has been consulted far too late, and its attempts at self-regulation (e.g. Product Stewardship, the Long Range Research Initiative and "Confidence in Chemicals") have been completely ignored by the rapporteur in this report.
The chemical industry currently produces more than 1 000 compounds, some of which are very persistent, that is, highly resistant to environmental degradation.
The cigarette industry claimed that their cigarette products are for adults, yet every piece of practical evidence suggests that clever marketing and advertising only results in recruiting the next generation of smokers, who are teenagers.
It is work for those in the pipeline industry.
The hand-rolling tobacco industry is less automated than the cigarette industry and therefore needs a more concentrated work-force.
The tobacco industry should not, therefore, be allowed to market snuff as something healthy.
The liner industry itself is more divided.
Industry has been decimated or allowed to decay.
European industry is better placed as a major competitor when it comes to defending its share of the market.
Industry is clever enough to protect itself against such free-riders, or, if you will excuse the expression, these wolves.
Industry and citizens have generally benefited, as demonstrated by the results of performance and evaluation measurement.
European industry plays a key role worldwide in developing new products, hi-tech and unwoven textiles for new applications, and products for cleaning, the car industry or the medical sector.
European industry has no choice but to invest in its strengths, such as its human potential, its capacity for innovation and its SME-based entrepreneurial fabric, thereby setting itself apart from its competitors.
According to the gene tech industry, the risks of such unwanted contamination are low.
The pharmaceutical industry, however, selects its patients on the basis of their resources – I am thinking of the diseases of poor countries – or on the basis of the numbers of patients involved.
The medicinal products industry is prepared for a complete traceability system, with a bar code enabling the tracing of each medicinal product.
Industry will benefit from the reduced time between the submission of an application and the ability to place the product on the market, meaning savings in administrative costs and the possibility that it will reach the market earlier, increasing sales profits.
Industry will be motivated to improve the environmental characteristics of products with a significant capacity for self-regulation.
The ineffable Commissioner Mandelson is like Molière’s doctor: he waits for his patient to die in order to ascertain his illness.
The current procedures are glaringly inefficient.
The European Union's inefficiency became legendary in Sarajevo.
Inequality begins in the training period.

The influence of oligarchs is decidedly negative.
The influence of global warming on daily weather is obvious.
However, avian flu is not a new disease.
The information was transferred immediately to all Member States through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed.
Insufficient information has been provided for farmers; risk criteria have been used very infrequently; the management, control and reduction system is too complicated; insufficient consideration has been given to cases of minor non-compliance; control rates are not harmonised; prior notification of controls poses a problem.
Here information is a necessary lubricant.
Information should be clear and accessible, which is often a problem in the transport sector.
But information must be objective and not based on pamphlets or suitably slanted data from the industry.
Information should upset politics.
Education must be adapted to take account of these changed circumstances.
Information must get to the various agencies in specific form.

Information and prevention are essential, and the use of condoms is extremely important in this context.
Information for and health education of citizens on the prevention and timely detection of symptoms which give danger signals, together with reliable screening, have brought about positive results, such as, for example, with breast cancer, which affects a large percentage of women of reproductive age.
The knowledge of how to clone a mammal from a cell from an adult individual came as a complete surprise to the decision-makers.
Genetic information can only be discovered, it cannot be invented.
Accurate information must not be given in the form of advertising.
The information should only need to be kept in a few exceptional cases.

Inhaling the solvent called DEGME is harmful to human health.
The unthinkable has happened.
The Atlantic Interoperability Initiative to Reduce Emissions is a most interesting idea.
The citizens' initiative is like a newborn baby.
Maybe the growth initiative is moving in the right direction, but it is inadequate in terms of both quantity and quality.
The Commission's initiative is very praiseworthy, and the slogan a flower for the women of Kabul is also a very kind and somewhat romantic one.
The EU initiative covers the most comprehensive possible list of major infectious diseases but is not restrictive, which was the main problem with the negotiations in 2002.
The e-Europe initiative praises the use and expertise of Internet and multimedia.
The transparency initiative, which has found one of its key supporters in your Presidency, is one way out of this anti-democratic cul-de-sac.
This was a praiseworthy initiative.
Added to this, methane emissions increase by 1 % a year - almost 500 teragrammes per year. Since the average life of methane in the atmosphere is relatively short and varies between 8 and 17 years, it is more effective to combine the fight to reduce methane emissions, either through a decrease in emissions or combustion.
The TBVI should not be considered in isolation from other initiatives for supporting clinical trials.
The situation is too appallingly unfair for this.
The injustice lies in how the burden is distributed.
Wrong remains wrong.
Injustice in legal form is on the march, and it must be fought against.
Their use must be absolutely safe in terms of health and may not act as a replacement for health and hygiene measures or for good manufacturing or agricultural methods.
Innovation is not just new production methods or new uses, for example, of local products.
Innovation is important, and that is how global warming is decelerated.
Innovation, research and development are of key importance as well.
That innovation does not come about by handing out extras to the pharmaceutical companies.
Innovation is not invention.
Innovation will not come from dinosaurs.
Innovation may result in the development and reinvention of the European Union once the current crisis is over.
Innovation also shows in new approaches, new methods and new mentalities.
The concern that emerges from this is that we are selling the European brand as if we were selling a can of Coca-Cola or a pair of shoes.
The growing concern mentioned by Mr Fitzsimons relates to the use of soft PVC in toys and childcare articles such as teething rings, and not of PVC in general.
In Andalusia, there is enormous concern about this issue.
There is enormous concern among the citizenry.
The concern is for next winter.

The inclusion of an 'employment chapter' in the new treaty will help.
I will list four of them.

The whole interpretation has been made available for your inspection.
The entire text has already been the subject of overall reading in the working party. It has also been examined by the Article 36 Committee and is now before the COREPER.
Integration has therefore relocated from the battlefield to the conference hall.
EU integration is like a tango.
Incorporating disability access at the product-design stage is cost-neutral or adds at most 2-5 % to overall costs, whereas creating a separate specialist product and market is expensive.
The incorporation of women into the workplace is a reality which cannot be reversed and women cannot be put in a situation of having to chose between having children and keeping their job because of the complications which a pregnancy may entail.
It is also essential for the functioning of healthy, humane democracies.
It is also useful to extend the monitoring system to include anthropogenic emissions and reductions.
Integration in the first place has to start with development.
Integration is a two-way process.

It is also of significant help to those who subsequently return home.
Integration in this area can for that reason only be achieved by means of coercion.
Radical Islamic fundamentalism, though non-violent, is also on the increase in a number of countries.
The integrity of these rules will be tested by attempts to dilute them for national reasons.
Integrity of cemeteries is not a case to accept.
The surge in sedentary occupations, the increase in cars, the reduction in exercise and the increasing consumption of food and drink with high energy content are causing significant health problems for our citizens.
This intensification has a significant environmental impact and marginalises less productive locations.
The intensity of the feeling is of course mainly attributable to the fact that most of the victims were children.
The intention is laudable, but the reasons behind it exaggerated and the result out of proportion.
The intention is that the Commission should review the use of additives E 432 to E 436 (that is, polysorbates), E 251, E 252, and E 249 to E 250 (which are nitrates and nitrites) and that, before 1 July 2004, the conditions of use for parabens, from E 214 to E 219, should be revised.
The intention was to amend the rules that currently require all feed materials in a compound feedingstuff to be indicated with a declaration of percentage by weight.
The reference was clearly intended to place that fellowship within a pejorative context.
The intention was for the new system to come into operation in 2005.
It has never been the intention to protect the sector on the basis of improper arguments.
The intention is not to question the basic ideas of these conventions, only to ensure that they are no longer used by ill-intentioned people.
Gene-environment interaction and cancer development will also cover lifestyle and other major risk factors.
Interconnection is not just developed by one Member State: you need at least two for this.
Mutual dependence is a good thing for Russia and the EU, as long as it is exercised in the right way.
The interdependency and interconnectedness of our existence with other forms of life on the planet is neglected, undervalued and played down.
Interdependence requires that diversities are taken into account, where possible, in the transition from plurality to unity, and it must be regulated by maintaining a balance in the relationship between the identities, diversities and co-existence of the models.
The ban on gatherings and demonstrations has also been lifted, except for several areas in Harare.
The substance of the British ban is that such meal and such feed must not be given to any farm animal, so pigs and other livestock must not be fed with it.

This applies to button cells, and batteries for hearing aids are no longer at risk either.
Because they cannot use Smoltine, which deals with transferring the fish from fresh water to salt water, they have to use hydrogen peroxide, which is very costly and has very serious effects on the life of the fish.
The ban you mention is not on a welfare basis but rather on an ethical basis, which is a different issue.
The ban on chlorinated chickens for consumption must continue to pertain.
A ban would see the end of the tradition of barometer-making and craftsmanship, which began over 400 years ago when mercury barometers were first introduced.

The common interest is obvious and clearly defined.
The assessment of the main problems and the measures proposed have been somewhat overshadowed by the substantial interest in paragraph 29 of the resolution.

Interoperability should and must be made a reality across the entire network.
Interoperability is the next item on the agenda, and we are currently setting the points for more intermodality.
Interpretation is always a separate process.
Interpreting Article 7 of the Treaty, we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction does not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpretations or performances themselves as such that are embodied in recordings, but also protection against copying, whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or temporary, and protection against any other form of production.
The interpretation of the Articles in the Treaty seems to depend on which way the wind is blowing.
The interpretation must in fact be teleological, relating to the intended purpose.

The introduction of the euro will have as much effect on those countries which remain outside the project as those which go in the first wave.
The introduction of the euro has only limited effects on transfer costs.
The introduction of the euro should not be at their cost.
The introduction of the euro did not come overnight and it was not a surprise.

ISIS has also implied severe restrictions in the fisheries of nephrops, plaice and sole with - and I quote - 'stringent restrictions on the catch and discard rates of cod with effective monitoring of compliance with those restrictions'.
Islam has made another step forward.
Islam is a religion based on tolerance, not fanaticism, a religion based on love, not hate, and it is a coherent religion based on order, not chaos.
The Islamisation and the stealthy phasing-out of the current state apparently take precedence.
Unlimited Islamisation of Europe is not on!
Wahhabi Islam persecutes Christians and does not allow them anywhere to worship.
Iceland, and the nations now stuck in your raspberry Reich, will be free at last.
Iceland and Icesave have been taking great risks for many years.
Solitary confinement must be the exception and not the norm.
Isolation in the field of energy means some monopoly's normal predominance in this market, and for the people concerned that in turn means both uncertain supply and high prices.

Failure to do even that would be a sign of complicity.
Do not build on flood plains.

We, as Greeks, have been very familiar with this means of transport for 3 000 years: the first cargo recorded in maritime history was the golden fleece carried by the Argonauts 5 500 years ago.
We meet with them at regular intervals.
We are eating too much fat, sugar and salt, and it is contributing to heart disease, diabetes, increased risk of cancer, strokes, liver disease and even depression.
There was not enough time.
We haggle with the Council – Mrs Grossetête is right there – for a billion more or less.
The following issues are mentioned in particular: the question of the procurement of vaccines and anti-viral treatments; information on recorded cases and their severity; the granting of access to documents relating to clinical trials, research protocols and adverse effects of medicines (by the European Medicines Agency); and conflicts of interest among specialists who advise European public health authorities.
We will not accept this Cold-War style niet from the Commission about the Guidelines.
Consequently, Amendments Nos 71, 72, 73, 101, 102, 103 and 107 are not accepted.
We do not, and shall never, agree with any measure that clearly or surreptitiously attempts to introduce forms of advertising, turning an ethical medicinal product into a commercial product.
We will not therefore approve this web of hypocrisy and impotence.
We are not going to measure standards in Europe by how many people drive a Mercedes 500, but by how many children do not have a glass of milk to drink in the morning.
Criminalisation will not get us anywhere.
We therefore do not go along with the excessive emphasis placed on promoting energy crops for obtaining biofuels, given that such crops use scarce production factors like water and soil, as well as various fertilisers.
We do not often welcome MICE into this Chamber, but the MICE – the fund for paediatric medicine research – is very much to be welcomed.
We should expect no less for Indonesia, with its Aceh separatists.
There would then be no need for Beijing + 10!
We would not have lucerne, which is used in cattle feed.
We do not allow people to drink and drive because their coordination is gone.
We have not even stated in the document that there must be no loss of nutritional value or loss of vitamins.
We had not achieved such levels of confidence since the previous expansionary phase.
There has, after all, been only one case in which a vehicle manufacturer has brought an action against another manufacturer for design-right infringement in the primary market, despite the fact that there have actually been some very striking similarities between models produced by different manufacturers.
We have no solid proof that they are yet affecting humans but there are many indicators such as the decline in sperm counts, and the rise in testicular and breast cancer.
We have no sympathy with the mutinies by the Ivorian army, which was formed and to a certain extent moulded by French soldiers and which, since its inception, has had no other purpose for existing but to oppress the poor majority of the Ivorian population whilst submitting it to extortion and racketeering along the way.
We do not have any drug that is able to destroy the virus and, as a result, in the West and in Europe, we have seen a decrease in mortality and an increase in the number of people living with the HIV virus, who can technically be described as 'potential vectors of infection'.
There have been no problems raised as a result of people having been excluded by the use of the definition - at least no major problems.
It only half-listened.
We do not need this new technology to produce more food into a market which is already oversupplied.
We have no defined limits for the addition of water to wine, but, for example, a limit of 7% has been defined in respect of adding water to concentrated grapes, as it is impossible to detect the addition of water below that threshold.
We do not have a fixed, preconceived idea of who gets what.
No decisions could be taken regarding any modifications, or anything of that kind, because no one in the Commission asked for any.
It was not done with EU schemes: this all began before the UK joined the then EC.
We did not, however, support the option of a fixed four- or five- month SPC extension, because this risks being unfair to smaller companies.
The long-term effects of the use of ecstasy are still very much unknown, other than we know that ecstasy is still a drug that can cause depression and memory impairment.
There are no statistics available, but there is no evidence of cannibalism.
It is not clear yet what the specific results will be following this visit.
We do not yet know the implications of this decision, which is based on an emotional reaction to reconstituted meat and not on a scientific assessment of the actual enzyme.
It got out of control. We do not know its effect on human health if any.
We do not discourage vaccination.
We need not discuss the safety defects in Bohunice, although perhaps I may raise just three of the most important points: as before, there is no replacement for the missing reinforced concrete and no pressure suppression system or other safety systems; the upgrading is inadequate seismologically; and the reactor pressure container is so brittle that the possibility of bursting cannot be excluded.
We should not underestimate those health risks, which include stomach and abdominal disorders, skin, eye and respiratory tract complaints and outer ear infections.
We should not include organs in this measure on cells and tissues.
We should not forget that there is no prophylaxis or treatment for transmissible and bovine spongiform encephalopathies in either humans or animals, that these diseases are always fatal, and that the impact chain with regard to the formation of these deadly prions has not yet been fully researched by scientists.
There is no data on the projected costs to carriers; no assessment of the impact on competitiveness - between both EU and other carriers; and no information on the direct and consequential impact of this legislation.
No scientific data are available on what residual amount of a given allergen may trigger an allergic reaction.
There is no available scientific basis that demonstrates either that the derivatives of certain allergens are still allergenic, or that they are no longer likely to cause adverse reactions.
We do not yet have any final data for 2005, but I expect no greater reduction for that year than for 2004.
Nor do we have any information on substitutes to plasticisers which might have toxic or chronic effects.
We are not only speaking about CDs and handbags, but also machinery and hi-tech products.
We are not paying any state assistance for the capacity that remains.
We do not make similar calls in the case of Ethiopia, since it would be all too obvious that they are pointless.
This is not required for other groups, so why the web-bloggers?
There is no lack of information from us.
The mines have not just been left in the ground unsupervised: they are in storage and guarded.
No longer do we hear the sound of bells or barking dogs.
We shall only be landing 25 000 tonnes of djaboï as a by-catch, so as not to discard it.
In our opinion, a simplified registration procedure should not be used either for medicines for human use or those for veterinary use, which can enter the food chain.
We cannot have any repetition of the situation in Germany, for example, where babies only a few months old have been taken away from their mothers because there are no mother and child places available in prison, leading to months of separation.
We therefore cannot support the proposal that clinical trials of medicinal products can be begun if authorisation has not been given by the expiry of the time limit.
It is unacceptable to us that clinical trials of medicinal products for human use can be started under any circumstances without being directly authorised by the Member States, but simply once the authorities have been notified.
We cannot preclude the possibility that the new generation of insecticides applied mainly using the method of immersing seeds is harmful to the environment and public health, especially when these preparations are used in different countries and after germination in order to combat certain plant enemies, with the result that their residues are greater during blossoming and in the final product.
We cannot limit the spreading of manure only in cases where it is suspected of disseminating an OIE List A disease, as certain Member States have additional eradication measures for diseases not included in that list, such as salmonella.
We cannot forget that a considerable number of workers suffer from the effects of their exposure to vibrations, notably neurological, vascular and musculo-skeletal disorders.
It cannot be the case that children can take up many times the quantity of carcinogenic substances in just one hour of skin contact than are contained in the smoke from 40 cigarettes.
Expansion must not be used as a scapegoat.
It is not proper to ask Egypt, which already accommodates between two and three million Sudanese, of whom 27 000 are registered with the HCR, to receive all of the refugees from that country.
It cannot be reduced to an elite theatre set where first-night performances of any old small provincial theatre production are put on free of charge.
We cannot talk in generalised terms about the overcapacity or the overfishing or the lack of compliance.
We simply cannot allow scientific progress and the potential treatments that result to erode ethical boundaries.
We can only watch as the number of check points increases rather than decreases.
We cannot help feeling suspicious about the way these posts are to be filled, given that it will be mainly by 'redeployment' and 'rationalisation' rather than recruitment.
We cannot accept that there should be first- and second-class patients: they must all be equal, regardless of sex, age, place of residence or any other criterion.
We are not prescribing a specific instrument; that is for you to do.
At that time, we received pitying smiles.
We do not even know into what matrix we are squeezing it, let alone how to evaluate and set the criteria for the long-term safety of nuclear storage sites.
It is not clear how GEEREF financing is going to filter down to Community-level projects such as PV panels for health centres and schools or solar cookers and water heaters.
Less clear, however, is why the production of protein has to be reduced too in the light of an increase in demand on the European market.
Maybe we will not even be mediators there but facilitators.
Further surprises can never be ruled out.
This is not the moment of the Oslo agreements, or the elation in Washington or Casablanca - this is not a moment for elation.
Individuals are not exposed to kerb side concentrations continuously. It is the building line which is important and that may be more than five metres from the kerb.
We are not in the business of knee-jerk reactions and responses.
We are not in favour of the proposal from the Committee on the Environment to double the limit value for the carcinogenic trihalomethanes to 110 microgrammes per litre, in excess even of the Commission proposal.
It is not clear whether daily access to the medical treatment he needs is guaranteed and whether he can count on doctors' assistance during his detention in the Beijing Municipal Detention Centre in Dougezhuang.
We are not all uneducated and illiterate.
This is no longer the scenario.
We are only 50, maybe 60 people maximum, out of 785 MEPs.
We do not support the Commission's view that all new active substances for veterinary medicinal products should be authorised under the centralised procedure.
International aid must, without fail, be well coordinated.
This is not some kind of agricultural marathon, where one has to adjudicate between carrots and turnips.
We would not want to be treated by a drunken doctor and I do not believe that we should be treated by an over-tired doctor.
We should not have GMOs containing antibiotics or resistant genes, or GMOs which can cross-pollinate with their cousins in the wild.
We do not want to be involved in the stigmatising of alcoholic drinks with the sole exception of areas where new products may present a health hazard for the unwary.
We do not want the cohesion policies to be compared to Emmental cheese, which looks very compact on the outside.
No more pseudo-prudential protectionism, please!
No more softly, softly on Helms-Burton.
We have no reason to keep it on or take it off.
Hardly any GMOs are being exported, at the very most products produced by means of them.
Results will not be achieved either easily or immediately; it will take some time.
Nous n'oublierons jamais.
It was expected that EFSA would not find clear safety concerns related to food products from clones of farm animals, compared with conventionally-bred animals.
Climate change is expected to lead to a reduction in rainfall, higher temperatures and a higher incidence of heat waves and periods of drought, leading to increased desertification.
We expect inflation for the remaining months of this year to hover around this level of 2%, then early next year, mainly due to base effects, to fall significantly below the 2% limit and then, later on next year and in 2005, to climb back somewhat in a direction that will bring it close to 2%.
We are flying to Dhaka tomorrow, in order to gather first-hand information about the situation in Cox's Bazar and the Bandarban region.
We are concerned about the relatively short duration of the authorisation granted to service providers (5 to 10 years) and the reintroduction of financial incentives.
We are very concerned about those areas in which no significant improvement has been observed.
We are concerned also at the increased number of reported cases of torture and ill-treatment, in particular, outside official places of detention.
We are also wondering about safety with regard to the use of wholly or partly genetically modified foods, and about the weight of that problem with regard to baby foods, pharmaceutical products or products on general sale such as vitamins or integrators containing animal gelatines.
We like to think of the United Kingdom as a rich country, but one in five pensioners are in low-income households; the incomes of those over 75 are lower still.
We are particularly concerned that the consumer will be exposed to the risk of a break in the sales and after-sales service link if the distributor is able to award after-sales service contracts to authorised repairers which are not subject to a location clause.
We especially welcome point 1 of Annex I (respect of the principle of non-refoulement, the consideration of the special needs of vulnerable persons and those who are in need of urgent medical assistance, training for border guards in human rights and refugee law) as well as points 3 and 4 (including consideration of the migrant's situation, taking into account their possible requests for assistance or the seaworthiness of the ship, no disembarkation in countries where persons risk being persecuted and tortured) mentioned in Annex II.
We are presented with a ludicrous situation in which the repatriation of a corpse from Salzburg to Freilassing – a distance of ten kilometres – requires a zinc coffin, but the transfer of a body from Ivalo to Helsinki – a distance of 1120 kilometres – requires no such coffin.
We have a situation where abundant information is available on the web, which is not validated and makes the consumer extremely unsure, which concentrates on products which are not on the market and which confuses many citizens when they visit their doctors.
Data processing and satellites are not yet fully utilised.
We no longer use thermometers containing mercury, and amalgam is generally not used for repairing our teeth.
We are making slow and painful headway.
We place patients who are already in a difficult situation in the position of beggars who have to find sponsors in order to obtain treatment.
We constantly hear shocking information, such as that softeners can also find their way into the food chain, as they can be absorbed in fatty foods.
We are also allowing for the granting of partial decommissioning.
No situation is free from risk. Worse, that risk is sometimes hidden, not immediately obvious, does not strike us at once, and is difficult to detect.
We talk much about education and its outstanding role in changing attitudes, contouring behaviours, integration of groups with high risk of marginalisation and development of communities.
We are talking about red traffic lights and speeding, but we are not talking about the operation of traffic lights or roundabouts, or about not using mobile phones and smoking when driving, or about driving courses in the European Union or general fines which would have shocked even the most hardened offenders.
We are talking about protecting textile designs, for example, or designs in glass or plastic - all the types of design which may be involved in a given industrial product at a given time.
We are talking about substances causing neurological and hepatic disorders, of all things, and they are not allowed to know anything.
We are discussing aromatized wines, wine-based drinks and wine-product cocktails.
We are talking about traffic not only in anabolic steroids, stimulants, diuretics and hormones, but also in medicines used to treat a number of dangerous illnesses, which in this case are sold freely and at a lower price, even though they require a prescription.
In fact, we are talking about a safety margin at least 50 times lower than the levels for which possible health effects have been established.
We often talk about the importance of the role of women, but there can be no starker an example than this of the damage that occurs when women are powerless.
The number of Member States is to increase from 15 to 25, and the number of MEPs from 626 to 732.
The price of your failure would be awful.
‘We pay, they spend’ simply will not do.
We thought we had warded off the danger, but soon afterwards, the coastline of Galicia was ruined by the tar from an even worse accident than the previous one: the Prestige.
We think of this in terms of swallowing something or strangulation, but there is a more covert killer and that is cancer.
It certainly seems to us that where the tectonic plates of the world’s three great monotheistic religions – Christianity, Judaism and Islam – are rubbing up against each other and causing sparks to fly, we need to proceed with extreme caution.
For example, we have in mind the introduction of exemptions from pilot service in ports where captains can demonstrate they have a high level of experience.
One thinks of the so-called marginally conforming aircraft, which are equipped with hush-kits that only marginally comply with the standard for Chapter 3 aircraft.
We believe that this rule helps pharmacies carry out their difficult role in pharmacovigilance and education on the correct use of medicinal products.
It is our belief that Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 cannot be deleted without being replaced.
We found that the text was too watered down (for example in the votes pertaining to par. 33).
We think it is essential that all applicant donors are fully aware of the risk that donated blood and plasma can transmit contagious diseases.
We think that it is important to give children healthier eating habits.
We believe it is necessary to examine the possibility of warning consumers of such potential allergic reactions.
An industry is being maintained which is both harmful to public health and unprofitable.
In terms of the most important factor of production - the human factor - we have top-quality resources.
There may also be conceivable scenarios in which the New York stock exchange and a newly formed one joint with the LSE or, on the other hand Euronext and Deutsche Börse might get together.
What might be a possibility is for us to set a limit of, for example, a 2% proportion of trans-fatty acids in total energy intake.
We could restrict regional payments to recipients with a maximum not of 50, but of 100, 200 or 500 and more hectares.
One could go on for hours about this sorry saga.
We could copy the example of the blue flag.
However, we may be glad that none of the patients infected with this virus in the EU has yet died.
Positive examples are the Bay of Biscay, the Kattegat and the Skagerrak.
We can already see that in the new generation of aircraft: the Airbus 380 and the Boeing 787.
Therefore, this covers 3 830 cases, not 885.
Amendment No 9 is also acceptable since it allows time-limited extensions for the use of very small quantities of CFCs in a specialised type of medical devices for pain relief.
We can also rest assured that the products that Germany exported, and that were intended for the food manufacturing market, such as eggs, were tested and found to contain very low levels of dioxins, since they were mixed with other non German products in the food manufacturing process.
There might well be other causes for the increased number of fatalities.
We can train the permanent staff of organisations who have to train the volunteers.
We can help with our experience, and after Castro's overthrow, the European Union should help with its experience and its money, so that Cuba never reaches the situation, described by Polish commentator, Marek Magierowski, in which in the future, the descendants of Orlando Zapata, of whom frequent mention has been made in this Chamber, serve rum on the promenades and boulevards of Havana to the descendants of Castro.
We also see how wage differences are not decreasing but increasing, both within one and the same workplace and between the sexes.
Between the systems of authorisation and notification we favour the system of notification because with this system, when an application is submitted to the Ethics Committee, the regulatory authority will be notified, and the investigator may commence with the trial thereby cutting the bureaucracy to a minimum.
We take medicines to relieve pain, to alleviate the symptoms of diseases or to save our lives.
There is an overall shortage of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs, particularly of protein crops, and deficits in the area of protein production.
Therefore, we present a monitoring system which extends all the way from the manufacturer to the patient.
We claim that the proposed measures need to include systematic research with specific studies on women, since problems such as eating disorders, neurovegetative diseases, schizophrenia, depression and suicide have not yet been studied from a gender perspective and that means that the progress made in prevention and treatment is less significant than is needed.
We also foresee adopting specific technical rules with regard to the margins of tolerance for the amounts of vitamins and minerals declared to be present in food supplements.
Membership should be to the benefit of all Cypriots, however.
We really consider that aircraft inspections by organised engineers in accordance with Part-66 (Aircraft Maintenance Personnel Licensing) need to be restored.
We proposed maintaining the support measures until the normal production capacity utilisation rate was restored.
We propose that this value should be lowered to 400 micrograms.
The proposal is to replace the words 'so far' by 'except for the very last one on 31 October 2010'.
We therefore propose a two-stage regulation for PM2.5, with, in the first instance, a target value from 2010 onwards, and, with effect from 2005, a limit value around 20 micrograms; this too, is more ambitious than what the Council and the Commission are proposing.
We propose that contributions be calculated taking into account how hard the work is and the number of dependent children.
We propose accepting a combination of passive and active measures (which in any event could have been included in another directive!) in the event that we replace the European Experimental Vehicles Committee (EEVC) tests, provided that these passive measures do not constitute more than 25% of all the measures.
We propose a change to the method of data collection if results are not achieved within a certain period of time.
We object to risks taken in transport to Dounreay for the following reasons:
There will come a time when we will publish forecasts, either bi-annually or tri-annually.
We receive news from Kok Ksor and the Montagnard Foundation, for example on 28 April when Y-Tao Eban was killed by Vietnamese police and security forces, and on 15 April when two Montaguard Degar children were killed by four Vietnamese police officers.
We are receiving and monitoring reports on the sanitary conditions in these, the lack of food and the mental and physical ill-treatment.
We all recognise that the system should not be overburdened with too much bureaucracy, and we have acknowledged the need – certainly in some sectors – for self-inspection or inspection with a light touch.
We are afraid of having a 'witch-hunt' when naming and shaming is carried out.
In particular, we reject the amendments which would tend, first of all, to make the statement on vegetable fat part of the name of the product or place it on the front of the product.
So the burden, which is a common one, falls very unequally, with women taking a fourfold share.
We repeat that it is nothing new, whether in the reports on 'Women and industry', 'Women and health' or 'Women in rural areas'.
We will resist all temptation to drop one part or another, for to do so would jeopardise the round's entire equilibrium.
We therefore feel frustration, emotion and sadness as a result of the events of recent days.
It takes us back to a time in the 1980s when an SAS cabin consisted only of corporate executives, politicians and union bosses.
With the proposal to allow sulphite in the production process for breakfast foods, we are running the risk of sulphite residues reaching consumers without their being able to read on the product that it may contain sulphite, as sulphite is not included in the list of ingredients.
Equally praiseworthy are the results obtained with regard to medicine prices and the undeniable victory achieved over the egoism of the pharmaceutical multinationals.
We also welcome the call for the Commission and the Member States to take every possible step to ensure that women finally receive a full explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of hormone replacement therapy.
We also know that the feed concerned contains both zoonotic and other bacteria that are wholly resistant to antibiotics.
We also know that European film, particularly when produced in languages with few speakers, cannot easily maintain as large a film production as one would wish.
We also know that the rate of HIV among male prisoners is 15 times higher than among the general population.
We know this and also we know, and it has been proven, that early detection of cancer can significantly reduce cancer mortality.
We already know what this type of epidemic can lead to, particularly after the so-called 'tropical' genocide in which 50 000 people were killed in the same region of Goma.
We have known since 1997 that the H5 sub-type is highly contagious, that it is capable of being transmitted to man and producing a form of influenza with a high death rate, but that so far transmission is only possible through contact with diseased birds and their excrement.
We have known for years that there is at least one hormone that is suspected of being carcinogenic and that the other hormones have particularly adverse effects on young people during puberty.
We have known for months that a number of antibiotics in animal feed produce forms of resistance in humans.
We know from experience that this has been successful: production can be equally efficient, even if more care is exercised with regard to the animals' environment.
We already know that 3 000 children have been taken into the care of the authorities because their parents cannot provide for them.
We also know that the quantity of brominated flame retardants in breast milk has been increasing each year.
We also know that they have a very low reproductive capacity, and that there are around 87 different species of fish swimming together at these great depths, of which only around eight are edible or marketable.
We know in fact that as a whole, to generalise, the price of water colours is much lower than that for paintings and much higher than that for drawings.
We know - and a study published in The Lancet has demonstrated this once more - that heavy metals cause damage to the nervous system and also lasting, irreparable brain damage, particularly in children.
We know, for instance, that the consumption of hormone-treated meat is damaging to the development of adolescents during puberty.
We know for certain that the presence in the end product of traces of the aids used cannot be scientifically demonstrated, even though, in such small quantities, they are unlikely to trigger allergies.
We reckon that 5% of all hospital admissions are the result of adverse drug reactions and that adverse drug reactions cause a fifth of the unnecessary deaths in hospitals.
We know that these drugs are easily transportable and that they are not detectable using the means normally used to detect other drugs.
We know that they are slow maturing, not reaching breeding age sometimes until they are at least 25 years old, and they have a very low reproductive capacity.
We know that this is only the tip of the iceberg, and that the number of unreported cases of people being abducted without any form of due process, subjected to the most cruel tortures and then murdered is far greater.
We know that in 50% of these cases this could have been avoided if the patient had been informed about the nature of the medicine they received.
We know that there are dead bodies and 150 people are missing.
We know that, from the technical standpoint in COARM (Code of Conduct on Arms Exports), the work is done.
We know that the disease does not know and respect borders, and this is particularly worrying in case of this deadly disease to which people have no antibodies.
We know that it is specifically with cannabis that most people who end up mis-using heroin, cocaine and amphetamines begin.
We know that early diagnosis of this disease will increase the chances of a successful cure.
We know that early diagnosis is still the best method of improving prognosis and treatment, and that early detection will make breast cancer easier to cure and less traumatic for the patient.
We know that the most cost-effective way to combat cancer is prevention, and yet there are Member States, including Hungary for example, where this year money is only being put into screening programmes for mouth, breast and cervical cancers, but not other types of cancer.
We know that ADS is closely connected to excessive television consumption and over-stimulation.
We do know that the EFSA studies make repeated references to Monsanto.
We know that salmonella disappears in such products and only new contamination will reintroduce salmonella into them.
As we are aware, vaccines constitute an essential instrument when associated with better, cheaper and more reliable tests for detecting the infection, as well as more efficient diagnoses and treatments.
We know that the kind of fishing commonly carried out over sensitive deep-water ecosystems can be horrifically destructive - cold-water coral, sea-mounts and hydrothermal vents can be destroyed.
We know that obesity is one of the factors responsible for 'civilisation diseases', such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and consequent diseases of the musculoskeletal system.
We know that when you vaccinate cattle it can take up to 14 days before they develop immunity.
We know that you are also a legendary Member of Parliament, even if you were such as a journalist.
We know that there are more than 800 different pesticides, and many of these substances have carcinogenic or mutagenic effects and weaken the immune system.
We know that the issuing of an authorisation for a medicinal product does not, however, mean that checks are no longer needed on its efficacy and safety.
We know that one in three Europeans is diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and that the most common diagnoses are lung cancer, bowel cancer (which some people have mentioned) and breast cancer.
We know that many of these flights were routine flights used to transport equipment or officials, but not all of them were: Abu Omar, Maher Arar, Khaled el-Masri, Mohamed Algiza and many others were roughly loaded onto and transported in these aircraft to their prisons.
We are all aware of how often Jews have been persecuted for marrying non-Jews, and how often white people have been persecuted for marrying black people, and such persecution has always been carried out under the pretext of cultural incompatibility.
We all know that oil was first produced in 1968 from Prudhoe Bay on the Alaskan North Slope, but many areas of the Arctic have not yet been explored.
It is well known that PVC may present a risk when used in toys for young children.
We all know that tobacco is harmful to people's health; lung cancer, circulatory and heart diseases, cancer of the larynx, cancer of the tongue, cancer of the stomach and of the intestine are very frequently the scientifically proven consequence.
We know full well that as yet there is no toxicology study that evaluates the consequences of releasing GMOs into the environment.
Therefore, we have certainty that anyone who is given such a licence is a good driver of a moped, a motorcycle, a car or a lorry.
In this way, we will be able to avoid uneven responses and the prevalence of unequal conditions regarding access and treatment for the disease.
We will also take care to ensure that the current scientific uncertainty as regards sediments and biota will not create a kind of soft focus that will in the long term exempt the European Union from endeavouring to understand and improve the quality of those biota and sediments.
We will be under pressure to use the technology to 'normalize' humankind by selecting only those characteristics and traits which reflect some ideal notion of humanity.
We will be under pressure to use the technology to 'normalize' humankind by selecting only those characteristics and traits which reflect some 'ideal' notion of humanity.
We are blowing the final whistle when the score is 90 - 10.
We are treated to terms like ‘strategic objects’, ‘policy strategy’, ‘new directions’, ‘effective communications’ and ‘genuine dialogues’.
It is 6 April today, I just double checked, but I suppose you can declare April Fool's day as any day you want!
We live in an age where the volume of counterfeit products is multiplying; we can see this taking place in the case of clothing items, with Lacoste, in the case of watches, with Rolex, and also, unfortunately, in the case of medicines.
We are just coming up to Alpe d’Huez, and I think you should bear in mind that the winner of the Tour gets to wear the only if he makes it through the whole distance and wins every stage.
We agree to the revision of the Commission's control over 'listings of substances', 'withdrawal periods' and 'principles and guidelines'.
We all agree that scientific measures are needed, methods to be used in abattoirs to remove the ilia, the ganglia, the duodena, the inguinal, medial, lateral, renal, prefemoral and cervical lymph nodes, but this is not the key issue.
There is a consensus that other substances besides vitamins and minerals need to be subjected to scientific tests before they are covered by the directive.
We think that fantasy names should be allowed, especially for combined preparations, provided no therapeutic effect is implied or introduced.
We take the view that unemployment - the most visible face of this crisis - does not simply mean a loss of income for those who are unemployed and their families: unemployment discourages you and can lead to a loss of confidence in yourself and in those around you.
This is a total perversion of justice.
We are also entitled to receive meaningful answers, and then to see changes in the negative pattern that can currently be observed.
We want to see that both the average life and the rate of consumption of products is disclosed with the manufacture and use of the product.
We also all support the waste hierarchy where it is best to prevent, it is next best to re-use and recycle, and after that comes energy recovery.
This is a case of the proverbial ostrich with its head buried in the sand...
There are sisters, brothers, cousins, godparents, relationships that have endured for decades or centuries, refuges and enterprising immigrants and emigrants.
We have a situation in which conspiracy theories, innuendo and general misconceptions, lies and myths are told about what goes on in the ‘dark corridors’ and ‘cubby holes’ of the European Commission.
Many of us have seen documentaries, films and pictures showing dogs and cats having their fur removed even when they were still alive.
Many of us in the European Union are very grateful for the work of the Canadians, Banting and Best, in discovering insulin some 75 years ago.
There is a feeling that many have in this House, that you are in office but you are not in control of the overall system.

It is very good that the programme will not only include young people aged 15-25, but will be open to those aged 13-30.

We are all in the same boat: if the boat sinks, no one will be saved.
We are all quite happy to want safe food and safe chemicals, but - and the Commission is dealing with this in the right way - this has to be done on a risk-based system similar to that used for REACH: if a chemical is safe to use then it can be used, but if it is not safe to use then it should be taken off the market.
We are all suffering from "summititis", a condition in which wildly inflated expectations puff up before each summit.
We want Guideline No 22 to be deleted.
We also make it clear that the employer is responsible for enforcing the wearing of hearing protectors and the provision of individual training.

We follow general principles and criteria as regards how much processing is necessary before the origin of a product is decided.
When the public enter a hostelry, restaurant or bar, where mixed drinks and many varieties of food are prepared, we work on the assumption that they know what is in them and can also find out by asking.

Only a tiny proportion of waste should be destined for landfill, in conjunction with preventive measures to ensure that such waste does not harm people's health, the environment, or the eco-system.
Permanent abandonment premium for winegrowers
First, a certain caution and prudence are justified with respect to quantifiable goals.
In the first place, they do not see in it any improvement for them.
Firstly: aid in the form of food and sanitary measures for 770,000 recipients of support in Serbia.
The first is activity-based budgeting.
The first is that of recovery.
Firstly, the average agricultural income in the Europe of the 15 rose by 7% with large national variations, for example +32% in Portugal and –30% in the United Kingdom.
Primo Levi explained it very well in a magnificent book: ‘To understand is impossible, but to know is necessary and to remember is a duty’.
Firstly, that only animal by-products derived from animals fit for human consumption should be used in feed, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products.
firstly, a new agenda for Geneva that is not just the "leftovers" from Marrakech;
A first among equals.
Mainly, full compliance with the short-term target is delayed by one year; the level of the penalty for non-compliance - the 'excess emissions premium' - has been lowered; and the ambition of the long-term target has been decreased.
Especially in consideration of the nitrofen scandal, this also presupposes additional measures, particularly with a view to new countries joining.
Second principle: the relationship between taxes on alcohol and alcoholism is obviously not such that lower taxes lead to a higher rate of alcoholism and high taxes to a lower one.
I felt sorry for him and gave him the pen I had just used to sign, saying that at least his government would have a pen that knew how to sign the Treaty.
Taken at what level?
• fast decision making regarding funding: 14 weeks after the cut-off date
Taken together, the proposed increase amounted to just under 40 000 tonnes, which is less than 2% of the total quota amount of 1 948 000 tonnes.
Illegal distribution of works, of all things, is to be promoted, with artists being left defenceless.

Organic production
After all, there is more to life than production and consumption.
Illegally producing medicines by copying, or quite simply omitting, their active ingredients does not require large-scale facilities or investment.
Higher quality but smaller quantities, more stringent controls and the implementation of emergency measures are the order of the day.
To produce less in order to produce better: when will that message be really heard and understood?
Production for its own sake, to rake in premiums, the misuse of scientific research, the difficulty of monitoring certification standards on the use of transgenic products at consumer level, the use of antibiotics and growth promoters in plants and animals - all of these have continued.
Produced exclusively from sugar-cane juice, the designation 'agricultural rum' is a guarantee of quality recognised by consumers.

Make use of this to assess the difficulties created by the addition, by the Council, of Annex VII to Regulation 1628/96, which I believe represents nothing but a cake to be shared out between some of the senior civil servants who are so full of ultra-liberalism when it should be a case of showing intelligence and generosity after so much blood and tears.

When you wander around the famous Chicken Street in Kabul, for example, you see women in dirty old burkas begging, children begging, men standing around chatting.
Just look around the shelves in supermarkets and see what is claimed on so many products, including an increasing range of sweets and confectionery – some of those claims are frankly absurd.

Promoting a healthy lifestyle is a good prophylactic method which can prevent a variety of diseases and illnesses.
Product promotion is a good thing, provided that the product concerned is available.
Proportionality, progressive increase?
Proportionally, the number of deported persons would amount to half a million had these deportations taken place in three Scandinavian states - Sweden, Denmark and Norway.

Then the war came, and the observers were withdrawn.
Then some people got the idea of penning the animals in and depriving them of natural food because the meat produced that way was considered good and expensive.

Dip into the flexibility instrument?

Subsequently, I found in my records an article which appeared in the 'Science and Medicine' column of 'Le Monde' of 30 May 1990, which is around the same time as Mr Castille's note, and in which two female professors - one at the Maisons-Alfort veterinary school, and the other at the Saint-Louis hospital - drew attention to the risk of infection posed by the use of meat-based meal.
May I continue?
May I ask the Commissioner specifically about how these energy drinks are marketed in combination with alcoholic products.
Can I ask the Council what its attitude is in relation to the tube-feeding of patients with Alzheimer's, which is a widespread practice in the United Kingdom and Ireland?
May I request that they be withdrawn?
Can I go back to the Isle of Wight and tell the people that the new Interreg proposals will help islands like theirs?

May I also remind him that the job losses referred to are widely exaggerated.
May I finally call upon you to intimate that you will respect the outcome of the referendums, whether they be ‘yes’ or ‘no’.
May I make a final comment?
May I take it is as PPE-DE time?
Could I ask if that aspect of independent living is being addressed by the study and, if not, would you undertake that a study of the availability of personal assistance and the generalisation of such a scheme across the European Union could be addressed, and indeed the portability of it?
May I continue or must I stop speaking?
(Can I just ask why the clock is not running?
May I point out one error in the translation: 'municipalities' has been translated as 'Städte' in German.
Can I humbly suggest that you circulate this more widely throughout your department, because in the recent Microsoft case and in others before that – in the General Electric case, in the Tetra Laval case and in the TV premiership football case – access to information and files you are keeping has been one of the Commission’s weaknesses.
May I ask you to check that on the video recording.
Can I ask if you are serious?
The label has to cover 30% of the packet; 35% if it is bilingual.
Furthermore, assistance must also be provided for persons with restricted mobility, and this, from the time of booking; today, thanks to the Internet, there is a need for return journeys and official information.

Since it is not Parliament that decides on this, but the Council, it is to be expected that this increase will not materialise.
Since this agenda has no public appeal, Kony abducts children to lead his war.
Since they are monopolies, it is impossible to inspect them, as a result of which it cannot be verified whether the compensation requested is exorbitant or whether the government costs are exorbitant.

As the quantity of phthalates that might possibly get into a child' s system from toys is so small, the study group is not recommending that phthalates be banned.
Since the Veronica is now a flag-of-convenience vessel, what is the Commission doing to stop the Veronica from offloading in Las Palmas?
Since the EU likes to keep up the pretence that it has no competence for issues of taxation, it should not therefore interfere at all in the benefits system.

In the light of the need for persistent pressure, the Commission’s approach is the best one.
Since a third of the total cost of all diseases is attributable to diseases of the brain, the following measures are necessary: a substantial part of the funding for research into the life sciences should be devoted to the brain and its diseases, in particular Alzheimer’s disease, and the Seventh Framework Programme currently being negotiated should take this into account; a substantial share of spending on healthcare (prevention, diagnosis and treatment) should be devoted to these diseases; medical study programmes should be proportionately targeted against these diseases; a system of social protection should be set up, making it possible to give material support (care homes) and financial support to patients suffering from this disability and their families; and finally a European brain disease monitoring centre should be set up.

Seldom has a European Council meeting taken place in such difficult and tense circumstances.

Seldom has the need for Euro/Atlantic unity been more vital.
Rarely could the proverb about the bitter herbs have applied quite so aptly as in this case.

R & D activities (1997 annual report)
REACH should now instead be called RISK, standing for the registration but inadequate substitution of chemicals.
This has resulted in a weakened REACH, in which registration has been eroded and a positive result was secured only with regard to licences.
REACH is a significant improvement on the status quo.
REACH is a sham, therefore.
REACH requires any substance of very high concern to be banned unless a strong case for authorisation is made justifying its continued use.
REACH must not degenerate into a typecase that is still not full even after two or three decades; Europe will have to be judged on its implementability.
REACH will rationalise this system and will register, evaluate and authorise chemicals that were never previously tested for their impact on human health.
REACH will be workable.

Recently - this also affects me as an Italian - an Italian hospital in Kabul, one of the few that was working in a decent, modern way, had to be closed because the staff were threatened with reprisals, since the regime would not accept that women could work there in close contact with male doctors and nurses.
In recent days, Hungarian language signs put up on the walls of the trilingual Babes-Bolyai University were taken down by the administration, and roughly broken up in front of the students.

The early diagnosis of tuberculosis and the thorough and fully-monitored treatment of the disease, in other words, treatment that is uninterrupted and of sufficient duration, are the basic pre-conditions for reducing the risk of extensive treatment resistance and multi-resistant forms of TBC developing, the treatment of which is extremely expensive and difficult to obtain in many countries.

Information society for All
A liberalised society exhibits a mix of two ways of thinking: ethical pluralism and cultural relativism, which could be called secularist relativism.
Such an open society has to be fair and just and not a free ride for the criminals and the terrorists.

One very important point is that the partnership principle must be taken to a new and better level.
Another positive point is the extended understanding of the term 'insolvency' which has been retained.
Poison of that kind should never have left the EU in the first place.
Fish caught off Europe's shores is frozen and then shipped to China. Over there it is thawed, filleted, frozen again and shipped back to Europe.
One policeman was killed.
A pollutant!
A portal for information: yes!
A port is primarily a site. It is a strategic site; it is not a free-for-all service; it is not a supermarket.
A chicken said to a pig, 'Let us have a joint venture.
1%!
A large percentage of children from immigrant families only obtain a low level of education, and subsequently struggle with unemployment.
A large percentage of migrants come to the EU only for a 'better' life.
One percent comes here and is used for the wrong things.
One per cent? It might still have something in it.
One per cent is not enough!
However, I should first like to point out that there should be no generalisations.
In Luxembourg there was a trial whistle.
One first and important step would be for the staff complement in the new office in Katmandu to be increased.
A first step may perhaps be for a time limit partially to be imposed upon secrecy.
A first, important point in this report is the updating and coordination of existing rules on safety requirements for tanks and vehicles.
The first point is on the role of parliaments.
This leads to a legal process which finds you innocent, then finds you guilty, then starts over again until every appeal is exhausted and you are ultimately condemned to death, with due legal process having been thrown out of the equation.
A very important committee chairman once said that he expected 'de l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace' from the Commission - boldness, more boldness and forever boldness.
One important principle is that care of children and dependants should be compensated for in the pension system.
A sound principle is the one paid lip-service in policy speeches but ignored in decision-making: the subsidiarity principle.
A price which appears to be low actually represents a higher final cost, because of problems with quality, safety and adaptability.
We had a problem with two Leeds fans being murdered in a UEFA Cup game in Istanbul against Galatasaray, yet no action was taken against Galatasaray - they were not thrown out of the UEFA Cup.
A problem related to the market should be dealt with using the appropriate tools.
There is also a serious problem with nitrite when it reacts with compounds in the stomach to form products which have been found to be carcinogenic in many animals.
So there too there might be a conflict.
But the difficulty arises when labile components, for example red blood cells, platelets or plasma prior to fractionation, are prevented from being shared with other Member States.
And there is a health issue here too - many small pieces of meat glued together have a much larger surface area than a single, larger piece, which significantly increases the area on which pathogenic bacteria can thrive.
There are problems regarding the term "author" .
This leaves a serious problem: who is self-employed and who is a 'false' self-employed person?
There is a social and humanitarian problem because this project, which is under way, means that a population of 2 000 people has to be resettled and 900 houses demolished; and there is an environmental problem because this project will, in particular, involve the installation of a 400-hectare settling tank containing cyanide residue, necessary for the intensive treatment of ore.
One problem remains that is of significance to Austria.
A process has been discovered.
A familiar device is for the manufacturer to select an individual ingredient perceived by consumers to be beneficial and then to emphasise this using large thick letters, at the same time as using microscopic lettering to state, for example, the sugar and fat content.
A support process does not presuppose that the problem has been resolved in advance.
A codification or consolidation exercise would seem to be the most appropriate.
A monitoring process is planned, which is intended to be established in a transparent way via an online platform, and there is greater scope for the investigation of the factors that will decide whether significant damage has been done to European industry.
For us to be able to define a food as intended for a particular nutritional use, it should fulfil particular nutritional needs for certain categories of persons who cannot eat ordinary food, either because there is something wrong with their digestion or metabolism, or because in a particular physiological condition they can derive particular benefit from the controlled intake of certain substances in their food.
A product with similar characteristics has already been approved for the European market.
A defective product is defined as being non-conforming, and published statements by the manufacturers or distributors in advertising or on the label are included in this definition.
A different product or therapy incorporating or using knowledge of the same gene sequence should be covered by an entirely separate patent and there should be no derivative patenting.'
Something is required to contain certain ingredients, to be of a volume of not less than 'x' and not more than 'y', and even if that product was never intended for export, even if it never crosses frontiers, it can find itself criminalised and prohibited in its own country; and this is often because a rival somewhere in the EU - as often as not in Britain - which happens to meet all of a group of specifications anyway, uses the mechanisms of the European Union in order to pass on its costs to its rivals.
A product labelled as hazardous in one state is toxic in another, and harmful in a third.
It may be that a product has been used outside the EU for thousands of years, but has been available within the Community for only 10 years or less.

A Tacis programme has been developed to fight against the consequences of the drying of the Aral Sea.
Incessant technological progress means that we are increasingly able to transmit more data using less of the spectrum and with less interference.
A project like Desertec must not therefore be a way of using energy policy as a means to continue colonialism.
Moreover, when the project has provoked great resentment in the specific area of Athens because it will destroy...
A project such as EULEX could perhaps have been useful for a short while, in the first few months of 2008, in order to avoid any chaos.
There is a saying in English: 'If it ain't broken, don't fix it.'
It is a Danish proverb which I hope can be translated. It says: 'people who ride oxen get there too'.
There is a German proverb which says, "Hope is the last to die".
In Polish there is a saying that ‘if you do not get what you like, you have to like what you get’.
A Swedish proverb says that 'if you are too greedy, you easily lose the lot'.

One: what is culture?
Well, a quick glance at the scoreboard will show you that Ireland has misapplied EU directives on no less than 67 occasions and is in danger of missing out on the 1% transposition deficit target as agreed.
A reminder prior to and after a programme are sufficient.

. (FR) Yet another report on 'Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union', which will be followed up with as few actions as the previous ones.
An evaluation report is to be presented in 2004.
A Council of Europe report also refers to the persistence of ill treatment and unsuitable and insufficient prison buildings, as well as mentioning the inadequate activities and care provided, and of the increase in drug addiction.
A similar report from Austria advises against the use of phthalates.
The report is somewhat like the curate's egg – it is good in parts and not so good in parts; in fact, it is lousy in some parts.
A report published less than two years ago by the European Environment Agency and WHO-Europe concluded that there was an increase in not only respiratory illnesses, but a whole series of other diseases.
A report that should have been drawn up is not there.
A recent report states that two thirds of young people have received unwanted requests while using the Internet and 25% have viewed material with indecent content.
A recent Council of Europe report (Committee for the Prevention of Torture) points out that during investigations ELAS, the Port Police and the Customs Authorities concealed the existence of temporary detention areas for foreigners, while completely unacceptable conditions were found to exist at jails in Kozani and Heraklion.
A recent UK government report has recommended restrictions to child use of mobiles as a developing brain is more sensitive to electromagnetic radiation.

There is a recently written report from Spain showing that aspartame formaldehyde accumulates in cells, something that may destroy DNA and, for example, cause liver or brain damage, especially in the case of people vulnerable to such damage.
A report will then be made available in the usual way.
A special report, Report No 23, is in the pipeline.
A report on this issue was recently published under the title 'Mapping the maze: getting more women to the top in research'.
A report on the evaluation activities of the Commission is under preparation and should demonstrate the progress made.
A report on coastal areas is to follow.
This is a subject of the utmost importance: 10 people die each day in Europe due to the organ shortage; more than 15 000 European patients are on waiting lists; the average waiting time for a kidney - the most frequently transplanted organ - is more than 24 months in Belgium.
A recent survey in France by Sofres shows that 69 % of French people are against transgenic cultivation.

A ten-year-old fridge is an incredible power-guzzler.
They would get more money if they do not expand.
The past decade of the European Union has been marked by a history of constantly moving from leftover to leftover, the swill becoming lighter and lighter each time, and the fundamental questions losing weight all the time.
Good diet is especially important in children.
A different regime - almost any other regime - would be better for the Iraqi population.
A regime that does not allow young people to do their penance and mend their ways has no future; it will fall.
The transition period is illogical.
A central, European register of active substances used in biocidal products will not ensure safety, either, especially in view of the fact that biological agents are extremely variable and are resistant to active agents.
A public register of documents has been up and running since 3 June 2002, as required by Regulation 1049/2001.
A regulation in this respect is all the more urgent, because the costs involved in new safety measures continue to spiral out of all proportion.

Exactly which new data are to be collected and what is to be aggregated from these and existing data will be specified by an implementing regulation.
A 1986 rule required that the maximum aggregate length of beams should be reduced.
A negotiated settlement that is agreed between the parties is always a better settlement than the one that comes about as a result of court proceedings.
A regulation whose objective is to protect health cannot contradict itself and attack life, the supreme good of the individual from the moment of conception.
A similar regulation exists for protected designations of origin.
A provision for savings is also required.
However, I do have one regret: the proposal for a regulation leaves it to the Member States to choose between 'national' plates and 'Community' plates.
An effective regulator must be close to and must understand the markets it regulates.
A 2% increase in milk quotas is needed to allow Europe to respond to increased market demand.
A more radical and urgent overhaul, including an increase in the number of judges and the introduction of specialised chambers, is necessary.
Strengthening prevention and early diagnosis could cover nearly 70% of cases.

A network of Member State liaison officers has been created; a common risk analysis model and a common core curriculum for border guard training has been established.
An unelected executive cannot legislate and expropriate by means of recommendations and competition cases.
One clear result, of course, of the proposal before us to curtail or remove this subsidy on school milk will be decreased availability of milk and a drop in the consumption of milk in schools.

A six-page summary has also been published.
A summary of the findings revealed that most expressed the great desire for decentralisation and regionalisation.

The noise level from 'fluisterasfalt' [silent asphalt], as it is termed by our Flemish friends, or 'ZOAB, zeer open asfaltbeton' [very open asphalt concrete], as we like to refer to it in the Netherlands, is probably 20 decibels lower than that from cobblestone roads.
Silent asphalt and a change of tyre could help reduce the noise level by 6 decibels, which may not seem a great deal, but one should remember that decibels are a logarithmic table.
This is where there is a need for a complete turnaround.
A gun was dropped beside her.
There is however one risk.
More words for whom?
An eminent role awaits the European Police College, with an important task to perform.
They have a big role which should be fully prepared.
A similar role - in relation to young people of school age - is played by the Comenius programme.
One in ten Romanians suffers from hepatic disorders.
A wage of fear that is all too often an hourly starvation wage, one that compels people to calculate driving times on the basis of distances travelled, without giving a single thought to safety or their health or that of others.
Around the destroyed unit a nuclear shelter was constructed hastily, given the conditions, to halt the spread of the pollution.
A scandal.
At the same time, a similar scenario is being played out in the Committee of the Regions.
A second example is the medium whereby issuers disseminate information.

A degradability of 60% in itself is not enough.
A tolerance threshold of 1% for the adventitious presence of GMOs in non-GM products is realistic.

We can no longer have a situation in which one country is able to exercise its veto when appointments are being decided on.
Once should be enough.
'A Siemens' can be a lamp, a washing machine or a nuclear power station. There are b) also trade marks that designate group products, for example Adidas shoes, whether they are sandals or high heels.
This is just one more disastrous sign for genome research and for million of patients in Europe.
A light is on, but it is not yet red.
A clear sign of the steady deterioration is that even the official figure for executions in the year 1996 has doubled to 110.
In fact, a signal on rates is currently expected.

An increase in support should, however, be accompanied by the following three control measures.
So support in principle is there.
Strong European support is badly needed to moderate groups in Iraq.
Financial support is therefore needed.
- support for the restoration and development of the bee population, given the growing problems in this sector;
Structural support is said to cause subsidy-dependence.
Support will also be given to studies on cancer, age-related diseases and women's health problems.
There also needs to be support – paid out of the same amount – for national parliaments, enabling them to better discharge their monitoring function together with the watchdogs.

Careful monitoring will therefore continue.
Will there be a follow-up in terms of infringement if that Member State is found to be in breach of its requirements?
Effective monitoring and control of aid is necessary in that country in order to put a stop to this unfortunate tendency.
Environmental and health monitoring and surveillance could accordingly be carried out. This would help make the sector more sustainable.
Is reliable and regular follow-up available?
There must be monitoring and the law must be observed.
- a ‘Certificate Supplement’: attached to a vocational qualification to help third parties to understand its meaning;
- a ‘Diploma Supplement’: attached to a higher education diploma to help third parties to understand the meaning of that diploma;
This would automatically be an extra burden on the budget, and the extent of this has not yet been assessed.
The increase in expenditure will, however, result in a significant increase in food safety for the consumer, provided that the demands on businesses are bearable and affordable.
First, upon what does it base its risk assessment and how does it classify it?
An automatic system based on gold, as was the case in Europe before 1914, would allow for greatly increased stability with a minimum of choice.
An advanced system of good practice, the Benchmarks of Excellence, is also intended to be implemented this year.
A system made up of small steps is suitable for the implementation of this policy.
An accounting system has come to light that is described quite rightly in the press as being ‘as full of holes as a Swiss cheese’ and ‘as open as a bank vault’.
This requires a system for the conditional authorisation of catering waste for use as animal feed, a system that can be closely monitored.
A system in which each of the 50 directors-general would initially have 30 and later a good 80 staff members would mean bloated and expensive administration.
An early-warning system was put into place last year.
A good system is sufficient.
A system of this kind should also be applied to processed food products, indicating the origin of the main ingredients and raw materials, and specifying their place of origin as well as the place of final processing.
Such a system could function with an absolute minimum of acceptable risk to all involved.
A functioning exchange of DNA already exists through Interpol.
A successful education system rests above all on the quality of syllabuses and teaching.

Special preferences must be arranged for medicines and health care related issues.
We are to have an early retirement scheme that will generously reward those who no longer, even through retraining, can be made into functional tyres to go on EU wheels.
There is a promotion system which takes account of this evaluation and offers a certain number of points, which, consequently, form the basis for promotion.
There should be a system of the protection of religious values, not active persecution of people of other faiths.
An effective early warning and response system is founded on the following four components: identifying and assessing risks, constantly monitoring them, a warning and communication mechanism and, lastly, preparedness - the capacity to react and assist.
A single system of regulations is of course beneficial in both cases.
An equitable power sharing system was to be established, together with a rotating Presidency passing from Hutus to Tutsis every 18 months.
A single healthcare system run by the EU is a nightmare too horrible to contemplate; it should never be unleashed on an unsuspecting world.

A transport system which works well on the local level is better than a service which is terminated due to excessive regulation.
Something that has been developed for a sophisticated technology-based organisation is not appropriate for Joe's Cafe in Lewisham High Street or Jean Dupont's bistro in the rue de la Révolution in Marseilles.

a European system for monitoring the market and recording changes in prices of agricultural product and inputs, which could be combined with a similar international system under the auspices of the FAO.
A legal system which has no resources cannot operate effectively.
A good and effective system of scientific research management at European level is therefore essential.
The system will therefore be simpler, and also more generous.
Is a quasi-international Ponzi scheme, as it has been developing via toxic products during the past decade, to be tolerated?
A system involving one salary – even if this is higher than many MEPs’ present salaries – is better because it is an open system which can be scrutinised and assessed by the electorate.

A tax rate of 0.03% or 0.05% is not sufficient.
Such an agreement is generally required in all cases where there is a changeover from the cooperation procedure to the codecision procedure.
Such an increase could take place gradually, on the basis of appropriate, objective criteria to be defined.
This also required courage.
It has electricity, it has nuclear power, it has generators for water purification and it has helicopters.
All this will do is cause an increase in the number of non-attached Members, who often differ from one another completely and to an extreme.
Such a change goes far beyond the leaders and parties that led the Rose Revolution.
Such behaviour is intolerable. Just as was the harbouring by Ireland of three IRA terrorists convicted in Colombia.
Such behaviour may provide proof of their greatness.
Setting up such a criterion is totally untenable.
A challenge such as that should not be met with a small-minded response.
There has been no such time limit.
Such a delay in correcting what is, in effect, an admitted error, is clearly undesirable.
Such disarray is unacceptable.
Such endogenous development sometimes demands protection for emerging industries or services.
This is encouraged by the European Commission and by safety organisations.
Such a development is the way of the future and threatens those existing market locations which remain flat-footed in their thinking and their response to a changing market scheme.
A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard.
Such a legal document is certainly not available in the United Kingdom.
A crackdown of this nature will therefore also have to be reported.
It must be used as a starting point, not as the end game.
So any such instrument should also include bonus points for advanced training.
Such a mechanism would need to establish a General European Control and Supervision Agency for Prices and Services.
If waste were to be mixed in this way, it would result in hazardous waste being incinerated in incinerators used for household refuse.
Such an amount is in no way crucial to the success of a recovery – not that there are any indications of one.
Such a package is needed not as some sort of subsidy or aid.
Such a country will never achieve the unity which it desires.
This phenomenon cannot be tackled by any of the Member States on their own, based on their individual capacities.
Such power must at all times be rigorously justified and clearly explained.
Such a president also organise and plan for a longer period than just six months.
Such use, that is the use of hormones as growth promoters, is illegal.
This is not environmentally responsible practice.
Such a process is far too complex to be imposed by law all of a sudden and across the board; it can only result from negotiations at company level.
The process is open.
Naturally, a programme of this nature will need to be evaluated while it is in operation and any follow-up monitored.
I think this is terrible.
This rapprochement can also support change in both parts of the island.
Such a register has existed in the United States since 1984, up to which time - as still happens here - there was not even any systematic identification of abducted children, and no inquiry was begun until 24 hours had elapsed, long enough for all traces to have vanished.
There is no such regulation in any other sector.
Such a finding is not always negative for the complainant, who at least has the benefit of an explanation from the institutional body concerned.
It is only possible to achieve all this at the same time if all parties first remain calm and level-headed.
This could be achieved through a so-called 'scoping' exercise, which could be conducted after the summit.
If Europe were to present itself thus to the world, it would be a nightmarish sight.

Such a levy system is usually known as a 'Tobin Tax'.
Such a system would limit the maximum speed of a car to the maximum permissible speed in any given country.

This will result in falling standards in the majority of schools, especially in working-class districts and the countryside.
So there!
That is how it stands.
There you have it.
Those are all the events, or the diagnosis of the facts that the European Union has taken into account in order to react and act in response to this, and I feel that the EU has acted correctly throughout this period.
This is an opponent who already habitually hits below the belt, while the referee looks on indifferently and the judges argue about what the drug-taker's illegal punches are worth - full or half points!
This is another example of Iraq's attempts to divide and rule: to separate out elements of the anti-Iraq alliance.
This is another of the great messages of Tampere.
This is most undemocratic.
This is yet again an illustration of the much talked about squaring of the circle.
This is a way of working hard and fast but in a destructive manner.
This was an extremely courageous feat, and one which none of your predecessors achieved, in any case not the two men who were your immediate predecessors.
This is a major development!
An enviable role for this most changeable lady!
You see: there it is.
It is unbearable to watch the way in which these men and women are summoned to submit evidence of the acts of torture that they have suffered.
Poultry and Manure and Slurry.
Robbing a poor Peter to pay Paul is an inverse Robin Hood policy and is at best perverse.

You may think that the endless heckling is funny, but it does not get us anywhere.
Both your interventions - this one and the one you made earlier - have been recorded.
Your measures are fragmentary.
Your recipe will be contested, but not by Liberals and Democrats.
Is there not an absurdity, a paradox in your economic policies?
You were very precise and it was very interesting.
Your proposals and debates have influenced the major reforms of the Union during all these years.
Is this possible, based on your proposals?
Your proposals are neither robust nor enlightened.
You only want less, and you present this as an inevitable development.
Your proposals take approximately the same direction as the proposals made by the Commission in its own communication.
Your words do not contradict what I said.
Your words were much appreciated.
Your reassurances that all is well do not work.
This too will be included in the Verbatim Report.
Your reports on these three topics have therefore come at the right time.
Under your reforms you will break the link between production and subsidy.
No pretence is made that your regulations for public contracts are anything other than means towards the wedging open of the market; you may be putting two boxers in a ring, but one of them weighs 100 kg more than the other.
Your regulations, which are unconsolidated, dense, sometimes incoherent if not absurd, are not responsible!
Because of what you say and because of the difference in the testing procedures, which cannot be agreed, it is going to take some time.
You may be doing very nicely financially, but if you live in a densely populated city with too much air pollution, your quality of life is not all that wonderful.
Your attempts to resuscitate it are as distasteful as they are ill-fated.

Your approach in terms of reproductive health differs from mine.
Your comprehensive approach?
Member of the Commission. - The point you are making is very valid.

Your second request is the immediate abolition of visa requirements.
Your diagnosis was correct and you put forward concrete measures.
Your speech proved interesting enough to stop the clock.
Your speech was lacking in spirit.

Your document is also littered with mistakes and half-truths.
Your imperialist dogma of 'divide and rule' is well known.
Your Eminence, it was a pleasure to be able to speak to you this morning.

It will be of much greater benefit to what you want to convey if you speak either more slowly or without a prepared speech.

Your line that it is 'possible to find a consensus in the context of a process leading to a conclusion' is one of Sir Humphrey's finest.
Your reply was most satisfactory.
From your answer, I received the impression that the Commission is either unaware of the true situation, is not informed, or is trying to brush off MEPs.

Your Holiness, you are a personality of dialogue.

You even go so far as to ask for the immigration of second and third wives and their children.

You have a choice.
It is up to you.
You have the tools.

You all have a note to that effect in the voting list.
You all know about those special offers just before Christmas, when big companies buy 10 000 fridges in the Pacific Rim which are then marketed any old how through some kind of agent, and then, all of a sudden, once the fridges have been sold this agent and importer disappear and the SMEs who then have to foot the bill are the ones that suffer.

You had Airbus, you have the TGVs.
You spoke of two elephants; perhaps the third one escaped you.

You need to act and to act quickly.
You, in both of these institutions, must get a move on!

You should be ashamed of yourselves!
You should be thoroughly ashamed.
You for your part, at the Commission, should implement and test the measures agreed and then reintroduce them into the negotiations.

You might say that we have been tripped up by the acronym of TRIMs.

This gives the impression that, so far, four or five months have gone by and all the Council has really done is to read the regulations.
You even write in your document, I quote: 'The signs of recovery are clear'.
You are using other Members' speaking time.
You even make a very questionable assertion.
You have 350.
So close, indeed, that on Friday I know you will take very attentive note of how the WTO panel decides on the hormone question, and will definitely ensure during the presidency of the Council that the European Union adheres to its prohibition of hormone and growth enhancers.
You have already mentioned it several times.
You have two, could you try the other one.
To that extent, you are also responsible for it.
You have been informed of them.
You had the proof of that a few days ago.
You had a perfect example of that with the new restrictions and bans on herbal and alternative medicines which came in a couple of weeks ago.
You have benefited a great deal from them, my friends!
You have mentioned some progress and I will return to that.
Clearly, you have already put up with enough of that today.

You have one of them, for example, in the shape of the Swede, that is true.
You have used two.
You are aware of this too.
You will conclude that that is the area in which a reduction in aid can be best and most rapidly achieved.
You will agree that enough is enough.
The responsibilities of the Member States are another important element.
You know this very well.
You, Italy, are a clear example.
You in particular should be more reticent, Mr Langen.
You will get used to it and you will find it does not sadden you too much.

And finally, you are envisaging Eurodeployment.
You are considering privatization, delegating to third parties.
You see them all over the place, you see them in America.
What you are doing is conning people; it is a scam and the people are finding you out.
You try and catch them; you try and tag them; you try and follow them.
You believe that the political risk of revising the Treaty is greater than the legal risk of the further procedures.
You are thus acting as accomplices in this process.

The Austrians joined when the scheme was already operational and soon began to use the special production methods dictated by these environmental requirements as a cachet of quality for marketing purposes.
You know what is needed.
You are aware of the interminable discussions about how to repatriate the refugees, with the FDL and the HCR at loggerheads.
Do you agree?
Yet you are checked onto the aircraft, you have to have a boarding pass with your name on it and the airline is responsible for checking that the name on the pass is yours.
You are like the amphisbaena that was so dear to Césaire.
You are completely crazy.
You say that you are against war, but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that.
Do you agree?
You are in a Parliament that is very much alive.
You are perfect hosts.
You are all buffoons!
You are Celts - me too!

What you are saying is that the market remains more important than the environment.
You are turning the thing on its head, and you know what you are doing.

You are the only candidate.
You are the heirs of Sándor Márai.
You are the just like the pacifists and communists of 1938 who supported nazism and urged the allies and the French to desert in that war.
You are the heirs of Imre Kertész.
Are you ill?
You are like Michel Foucault: you believe that history is static, you believe in structuralism, with your model of the underdog living in poverty.
Many of you referred to studies.
You are a new Commissioner so you are not to blame for what has - or has not - been done in the past.
I forgive you!
You are with us, and you are answering the questions of the Chamber very well.
You have moved from rejection to a test phase.
You are predictable, consistent, reliable, and foster trust and confidence.
These clarifications can be made later outside the chamber.
You are as law-abiding as Vichy!
You remain sterile.
You are being reactionary if you cut yourself off from all new forms of technology.
If you do not mind me saying, you are like a hard-working ant, who achieves results little by little while the grasshoppers chirrup and laze around in the Member States.
You are strong enough.
You are as stubborn on this issue as a deep-sea fisherman.
You are all very welcome to attend.
You are very difficult to convince, Mrs in 't Veld.
You are a last-minute resistance fighter.
You are a first class European.
You are a public servant and this information must be made public; it must be in the public domain.
You are a very polite man and we are very grateful to you for that, but we could make even faster progress if you did not say 'thank you' after every vote, but only at the end of the vote!
You are a punctilious lawyer and you are right to say that if one takes the word 'rule' in its strictest sense, there are not hundreds.
You are a poor representative of your country if you allow this sort of thing to go on'.
You are a terrific speaker, and you are very convincing.
You are a servant, who has now adopted a position on matters that are the business of your masters.
You are, Your Holiness, an important advocate of dialogue.
Have you wondered if all the citizens have this facility, even if certain international federations have complied with this and allow these international events to be broadcast free to air?
You have indeed said what had to be said well within the time allocated.
You were the cause of the disorder.
You were already unique.
You were involved in its development, as were many others.
It may be that you still feel shy, or perhaps you were more anxious than you probably will be after some time has passed – although you should always be a little bit afraid!
You and the Commission really ought to go and look at what is available on the market.
You and Mr Booth are closer than you think.
You and I come from the same country, and we know that experiments led to a 30 per cent reduction in the quantity of material in consumer packaging over approximately three years.
You and your successors will be mandated by the Council only on paper.
You and your country.
You refer to comments in magazines, and say you have no evidence.
You mention changing the criteria, if necessary.
You are performing your work for Europe in a truly momentous period.
You have listed the main strands in your communication which you published in the first week of September.
You are showing yourself to be trustworthy.
You have also raised some concerns.
If you travel from Brussels to Amsterdam by air, you are covered; if you travel by coach, you are not.
You are treating Greece as a scapegoat, dictating measures against the workers, who are not to blame for the crisis, that will usher in similar measures for other countries.
You are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers.
You also combine words with actions: you do not just talk about ‘Europe’ at official events, but you also work every day on specific issues on the European agenda.
You are mistaken.
You show contempt for the MEPs' memory of events.
Endless imagination is used to justify the culling - yet in reality, very little imagination is needed to break away from this fixation with slaughter.
You are enthusiastic, you show your feelings, you are colourful in your speech and you use the right words.
Do you have any proposal to make?
This would therefore encourage the rise of extremism and anti-European nationalism.
You will make your position known to the services.
You should read the agreement!
So renew your frequent flyer package: Europe has never had a more important product to sell.
You should listen instead to the voice of the people and local communities!
You might do better to put your question to the contractor and ask if it is going to keep to its schedule.
You should make sure that you are better informed, instead of sitting shuffling papers and smugly concluding that on paper everything looks just fine.
Firstly, some are impossible; you make some suggestions that are impossible.
You thrive when challenged.
You are therefore putting Europe at a disadvantage in two respects: in terms of scientific value and also because of the fact that the lines from before 27 June 2002 are sold on the open market.
You have inherited a minefield.
You are shaking your head - but rather than just travelling to ministries, you should listen to the discussions on this subject in Europe's cafés and bars for once.
You ignored referendums, you denied referendums, and you bullied the poor Irish into voting a second time.
You are ignoring all these things; in fact, you are developing a bunker mentality, and perhaps that is a good thing, because at least it shows that the end is in sight!
You can imagine how they rate quality there!
You can immediately imagine the difficulty of monitoring that would involve.
You stress, with strong arguments, the human factor and the correct application of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers.
You are completely misinterpreting the Rules.
You would go to Germany or England.
You are playing a game with the timetable.
The others over there are being a bit quiet for a change, which is a better thing!
You mentioned it three times.
You can put it down to the fact that this is the first time I have acted as Vice-President.
You are presenting it orally.
You will receive it very shortly.
You have cut it by 8.2% and you have cut environmental policy by a hefty 28.2%.
You can find it in the Official Journal, L 30, for the year 2005.
You will have it before the end of the year.
You will have noticed that.
You will have it unconditionally!
It is going to be on your table.
You have confirmed that yourselves.
You have demonstrated this in your reply.
So you have admitted it.
You did it off your own bat.
You did it as the French President, and well done to you.
You did it for restaurateurs, and it needs to be done for public services.
You have invoked it and I would ask that you comply with it.
You have carried it out without any significant problems.
You mentioned it in only one sentence.
You have placed it fourth; I suggest you move it up a rung or two!
You received it enthusiastically.
Mr Walter, you referred to this in your intervention: the point is not whether agricultural policy expenditure will be reduced in 2001 in comparison with the year 2000; the point is what increase is needed.
You yourself classified it as more sexy.
You will understand this and you would certainly object - and rightly so - if the Commission were to express an opinion in other cases that are sub judice and where the proceedings have not yet been concluded.
You are aware of it. It is available for you to read.
You would describe it as outreach work.
You say so yourself, you point it out as a criticism.
You are legislating on the 18-month detention of wretched immigrants, including under-age children, in concentration camps where the living conditions cast shame on human civilisation.
You granted it to him.
You can hear its drums, trombones, crescents.
You can follow it and provide a real solution.
You can understand my Greek?
You know this as well as I. It is very frightening.
Do you know?
You have mentioned them and they are particularly important.
You have mentioned them all.
You have all read them; there are fifty of them in total.
Think back to that time when it was so - and, what is more, it makes sense.
You know what they are.
You are depriving them of both.
So we inserted into the legislation Article 4 designed to ensure that you cannot place on the market products which cannot be recycled.
You attack them today as xenophobes.
You attack them as extremists, but worst of all, oh worst of all, you attack them three times for being populists.
You can find it on the UK Representation’s website.
You will be describing what is to be demanded of them, and you have talked to us in terms of an October date.
You tell them that they must either leave voluntarily, or go to prison and then get deported after 18 months.
You then gave him more time!
You are missing the target.
You also ask, if four-fifths of all irregularities take place in the Member States, what is the result?
In this case you have me on your side, but if I were in your position I hope I should have rather more courage.
You asked how it looks with the Gross National Product component.
You therefore cut me off; you can protest.
The next question is, ‘What is this added value?’
You will say that this is not part of the normal procedure.
You will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike.
You make me feel ashamed.
Here, you are confusing apples with pears.
I miss you desperately!
You yourself can establish whether the quorum is present.
There will be none.
You are lying in that respect!
You may well be known as "BATman Bourlanges" although I cannot quite see you with a cape and mask, wearing underpants outside your pants, but you have done an extremely good job on the BATs!
You will thus assess the tangible and visible consequences of the extreme ultraliberal, ultra-internationalist and ultra-immigrationist economic policy carried out for the past 25 years by the European institutions and the Member States, with France at the helm.
You are now placing this book on the index of free competition because people do not know how to handle it properly.
You also asked me about the leaks that occurred from the Palestinian side.
Are you mobilising the extreme right?
You show us what to do when someone moves.'
You show that even in the dark days of recession, one can dream of Utopia.
Are you trying to make fools of us by publishing stuff like this in the Official Journal?
You do not need to resort to lip reading.
You will not get the opportunity to use it twice.
You should not have turned it into an announcement in the sitting.
You have not given in to the easiest options or to demagogy, and the results are there to see.
However, you have not answered the second part of the question in which I mentioned Munich-Mühldorf-Freilassing, which is part of the main line from Paris to Budapest and which is particularly important in view of the Bavarian chemical triangle and for relief of the Brenner access route.
You therefore have no reason to protest.
So you have no cause for concern.
You have honoured your monetary reference values only in the breach, and in 26 out of 41 months you have allowed inflation to exceed your target range.
You have never applied the brakes.
You have not even managed to obtain the other 100 000.
You only mentioned two abstentions.
You do not need to ask it again.
You just do not get it, do you?
You were not sensible, or at least this Treaty is not sensible, with tides of immigrants flowing in unchecked.
You have not humiliated the Chinese; it is the Chinese who have humiliated you.
You did not indicate whether the Council would be available.
You have not overpromised, but you have got on and delivered.
You did not heed Lenin’s advice.
Your contribution this morning was devoid of Eurospeak.
