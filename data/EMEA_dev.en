Concomitant administration of memantine with the antispasmodic agents, dantrolene or baclofen, can modify their effects and a dose adjustment may be necessary. • Concomitant use of memantine and amantadine should be avoided, owing to the risk of pharmacotoxic psychosis.

Such exacerbations have been seen following discontinuation of emtricitabine treatment in HBV infected patients without concomitant HIV infection and have been detected primarily by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA.
Although the mean Cmax and Cmin were approximately 20% higher and mean AUC was 16% higher in females compared to males, this difference was not considered clinically significant.
Dose or dose interval adjustment is required in all patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/ min (see section 4.4).
Early symptoms (symptomatic hyperlactataemia) include benign digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain), non-specific malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, respiratory symptoms (rapid and/ or deep breathing) or neurological symptoms (including motor weakness).
Rare cases of pancytopenia and very rare cases of aplastic anaemia, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in patients treated with Enbrel.
The efficacy of Enbrel was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
Radiographic changes were assessed in the psoriatic arthritis study.
In general, the adverse events in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult patients.
68 TNF and lymphotoxin exist predominantly as homotrimers, with their biological activity dependent on cross-linking of cell surface TNFRs.
Methotrexate doses were escalated from 7.5 mg/ week to a maximum of 20 mg/ week over the first 8 weeks of the trial and continued for up to 24 months.
At 24 weeks, 56% of patients in the Enbrel-treated group had achieved the PASI 75 compared to 5% of placebo-treated patients.
With twice weekly doses, it is anticipated that steady-state concentrations are approximately twice as high as those observed after single doses.
In some cases, particular fungal and other opportunistic infections have not been recognised, resulting in delay of appropriate treatment and sometimes death.
Infections (including upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, cystitis, skin infections)* Uncommon:
Among rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis patients in placebo-controlled, active-controlled, and open-label trials of Enbrel, serious adverse events reported included malignancies (see below), asthma, infections (see below), heart failure, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischaemia, chest pain, syncope, cerebral ischaemia, hypertension, hypotension, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, bursitis, confusion, depression, dyspnoea, abnormal healing, renal insufficiency, kidney calculus, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, membranous glomerulonephropathy, polymyositis, thrombophlebitis, liver damage, leucopenia, paresis, paresthesia, vertigo, allergic alveolitis, angioedema, scleritis, bone fracture, lymphadenopathy, ulcerative colitis, intestinal obstruction, eosinophilia, haematuria, and sarcoidosis.
Enbrel treatment should be initiated and supervised by specialist physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis or paediatric plaque psoriasis.
In a fourth study, the safety and efficacy of 50 mg Enbrel (two 25 mg SC injections) administered once weekly vs 25 mg Enbrel administered twice weekly were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 356 patients with active ankylosing spondylitis.
Please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step.

When looking at two of the studies together, where GANFORT was compared with its components given as separate drops (1,061 patients), and at patients whose pressure was not controlled with eye drops containing prostaglandins only (about a third of them), the medicine was more effective than bimatoprost on its own.
Therefore, GANFORT should be used with caution in patients with known risk factors for macular oedema (e. g. aphakic patients, pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule).

Imatinib adverse events, i. e. hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression or others, may increase and it has been reported that concomitant use with L-asparaginase could be associated with increased hepatotoxicity (see section 4.8).
Check whether cytopenia is related to leukaemia (marrow aspirate or biopsy).
Treatment with Glivec may be interrupted or the dose may be reduced, as
This time-to-event endpoint is strongly affected by the high crossover rate from IFN+Ara-C to Glivec.
Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) constantly exceeded 1 year and were superior to historical control (DFS p < 0.001; OS p < 0.0001) in two studies (AJP01 and AUS01).
The more frequent adverse reactions included gastrointestinal haemorrhages, conjunctivitis and elevation of transaminases or bilirubin.
For the patients treated at 600 mg, the current estimates for median progression-free-survival and overall survival were 22.9 and 42.5 months, respectively.
These events can usually be managed with either a reduction of the dose or an interruption of treatment with Glivec, but can in rare cases lead to permanent discontinuation of treatment.
The first 77 patients were started at 400 mg, the protocol was subsequently amended to allow higher dosing and the remaining 158 patients were started at 600 mg.
There was no change in the kinetics of imatinib on repeated dosing, and accumulation was 1.5– 2.5-fold at steady state when dosed once daily.
Although the results of pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there is considerable inter-subject variation, the mean exposure to imatinib did not increase in patients with varying degrees of liver dysfunction as compared to patients with normal liver function (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8).

However, this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study.
If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/ or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked.
Hypoglycaemia As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity, patients receiving pioglitazone in dual or triple oral therapy with a sulphonylurea or in dual therapy with insulin may be at risk for dose-related hypoglycaemia, and a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin may be necessary.
The other ingredients are lactose monohydrate, hyprolose, carmellose calcium and magnesium stearate.

Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
It should be noted however, that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response.
The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 l and 0.6 l/ h, respectively.
EXP Shelf-life after first use:
If you have periods, the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur, which is further described in section 4.
